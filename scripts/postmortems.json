The root cause was a missing filter in the database query (`GetOperationsByMerchantCurrency`) that failed to exclude operations already assigned to a batch. This resulted in 146 customers being charged twice and 1 customer receiving duplicate refunds, with a total financial exposure of 2,621,731.00 MXN in duplicate charges.\n\n‌\n\n![](blob:https://media.staging.atl-paas.net/?type=file&localId=null&id=5a6a1270-66c4-46c8-ba87-bebeb3c8617e&&collection=&height=691&occurrenceKey=null&width=1647&__contextId=null&__displayType=null&__external=false&__fileMimeType=null&__fileName=null&__fileSize=null&__mediaTraceId=null&url=null)\n‌\n\n**Root cause:** \n\nThe bug was caused by incomplete state reset during batch rollback operations, leading to operations being included in multiple batches.\n\n‌\n\nWhen a batch processing operation failed and triggered a rollback, the system only partially reset the operation state\n\n**The Problem**: The function was called during rollback with `isSettled = false` to mark operations as \"ready to retry\", but it failed to reset the `batch_id` field back to `NULL`.\n\n‌\n\nAfter a failed batch rollback, operations were left in an **inconsistent state**:\n\n```\n-- Expected state after rollback:\nis_settled = false   -- ✅ Ready for retry\nbatch_id = NULL      -- ✅ Not assigned to any batch\n\n-- ACTUAL state after rollback (BUG):\nis_settled = false   -- ✅ Ready for retry  \nbatch_id = 1         -- ❌ Still pointing to failed batch\n```\n\n‌\n\nThis inconsistency violated a core invariant: **operations ready for processing (**`is_settled = false`**) must not have a batch assignment (**`batch_id = NULL`**)**.\n\n‌\n\n**The Critical Missing Filter:** The query lacked a filter to check `batch_id IS NULL`, which should have prevented operations already assigned to a batch from being selected again.\n\n#### The Partial Fix\n\nA partial fix was deployed that **prevented the symptom** but did not address the root cause:\n\n**Changes Made**:\n\n1. Added SQL filter to `GetOperationsByMerchantCurrency` at line 282:\n\n```\nquery := d.DB.Where(\"merchant = ?\", merchant).\n    Where(\"currency = ?\", currency).\n    Where(\"is_settled = ?\", isSettled).\n    Where(\"status = ?\", status).\n    Where(\"batch_id IS NULL\")  // ← Defensive filter added\n```\n\n**Why It Was Only Partial**:\n\n* ✅ Successfully prevented operations with `batch_id != NULL` from being included in new batches\n* ❌ Did NOT fix the root cause: rollback still left inconsistent state\n* ⚠️ Used defensive programming (band-aid) instead of fixing the source of truth\n\n‌\n\n#### The Complete Fix (January 28, 2026)\n\nThe root cause was fixed by ensuring complete state reset during rollback\n\n```\n// AFTER (Correct Implementation):\nfunc (d *Database) UpdateOperationSettledStatusByBatchID(ctx context.Context, batchID int, isSettled bool) error {\n    // Prepare updates map\n    updates := map[string]interface{}{\n        \"is_settled\": isSettled,\n        \"updated_at\": \"NOW()\",\n    }\n\n    // When unsettling operations (rollback), also reset batch_id to NULL\n    // This allows them to be reprocessed in future batches\n    // When settling operations (success), batch_id is kept for audit trail\n    if !isSettled {\n        updates[\"batch_id\"] = nil  // ← FIX: Reset batch_id on rollback\n    }\n\n    // Update all operations with the given batch_id\n    result := d.DB.Model(&Operation{}).\n        Where(\"batch_id = ?\", batchID).\n        Updates(updates)\n    \n    // ...\n}\n```\n\n‌\n\n**Why This Is The Correct Fix**:\n\n* ✅ Fixes root cause: Operations have consistent state after rollback\n* ✅ Maintains audit trail: `batch_id` preserved when `isSettled = true` (success)\n* ✅ Eliminates state inconsistency: `is_settled = false` always paired with `batch_id = NULL`\n* ✅ Simplifies system: Defensive filters become redundant (but kept as safety net)\n\n‌\n\n‌\n\n**Impact:**\n\nThis incident produced two distinct sets of affected operations, each representing a different aspect of the bug's impact:\n\n‌\n\n**1. Financial Impact (Confirmed Duplicates Processed by AMEX)**\n\n* **Definition**: CAPTURE operations that were successfully processed by AMEX in 2 or more batches\n* **Measurement**: Operations where `COUNT(DISTINCT batch_id with status IN ('ACCEPTED', 'ACCEPTED_WITH_ERRORS')) >= 2`\n* **Significance**: These represent confirmed financial impact requiring reconciliation with AMEX\n* **Result**: **147 CAPTURE operations**\n\n```\nSELECT\n    COUNT(*) as duplicated_captures\nFROM (\n    SELECT o.id\n    FROM operations o\n    JOIN records r ON r.operation_id = o.id\n    JOIN batches b ON b.id = r.batch_id\n    WHERE r.type = 'TAB'\n      AND o.type = 'CAPTURE'\n    GROUP BY o.id\n    HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT r.batch_id) > 1\n       AND COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN b.status IN ('ACCEPTED', 'ACCEPTED_WITH_ERRORS') \n                               THEN r.batch_id END) >= 2\n) duplicates;\n```\n\n‌\n\n2. **Technical Impact (All Duplicated Operations)**\n\n    * **Definition**: CAPTURE operations that were included in multiple batches, regardless of final outcome\n    * **Measurement**: Operations where `COUNT(DISTINCT batch_id) > 1`\n    * **Significance**: Shows the full scope of the technical bug, including cases where:\n    \n        * AMEX rejected the duplicate (detected as duplicate by their systems)\n        * Second batch failed before reaching AMEX (ERROR status)\n        * Second batch is still in processing (OPEN/SENT status)\n        \n    \n\n* **Result**: **352 CAPTURE operations**\n\n```\nSELECT\n    COUNT(*) as all_duplicated_captures\nFROM (\n    SELECT o.id\n    FROM operations o\n    JOIN records r ON r.operation_id = o.id\n    WHERE r.type = 'TAB'\n      AND o.type = 'CAPTURE'\n    GROUP BY o.id\n    HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT r.batch_id) > 1\n) duplicates;\n```\n\n‌\n\n‌\n\n**The difference between 352 (technical duplicates) and 147 (financial impact) indicates that AMEX's own duplicate detection mechanisms prevented 205 operations from being processed twice, limiting the financial exposure.**\n\n‌\n\n‌\n\n‌\n\n**Short-term actions:**\n\n* Implement fix for stuck operations from ERROR batches\n* Add monitoring alerts for duplicate batch assignment detection\n* Add metrics tracking for batch health and rollback frequency\n* Generate complete customer refund list for finance team\n* Create runbook for stuck operations recovery\n\n‌\n\n---\n\n**Financial Impact:**\n\n* Total duplicate charges: 2,621,731.00 MXN\n* Refund exposure: 2,621,731.00 MXN (146 customers)\n* Average duplicate charge: \\~17,957 MXN per customer\n\n",

ClearSale responded normally; the issue was Kafka topic lag in our internal fraud-response pipeline. The exact cause of the lag is still under investigation.\n\n**Root cause:**  \nProximate cause: Lag in a Kafka topic that delivers the fraud-response message, delaying progression of payments after ClearSale’s response.  \nDeep root cause: A rebalance of the Kafka consumers for the affected topic occurred, which temporarily reduced the effective consumption rate and caused messages to accumulate. Once the lag was detected, the Core team triggered a redeploy of the service consuming this topic; however, this action introduced additional delay by extending the time required for the consumer group to complete its rebalance. After the new instances stabilized and the consumer group finished rebalancing, the consumers resumed normal operation and fully processed the accumulated backlog of messages.\n\n**Impact:**  \nMedium\n\n**Description of the incident's impact:**  \nMerchant / Provider / Country: Q2 Ingressos / ClearSale / BR.  \nTraffic affected: \\~10–30% of Q2’s volume in the window.  \nUser impact: Payments appeared “stuck” for up to \\~1 hour; some users repurchased, creating duplicate approved transactions for the same tickets.\n\n**Detection:**  \nThe issue was reported by Q2, not by automated alerts.  \nThey shared:  \nThe \\~1-hour gap between ClearSale Create Order and Update Status.  \nImpacted traffic estimate and examples (trace ID, payment ID).\n\n**Response and recovery:**  \n2026-01-16 14:04 – Q2 reports the delay and duplicate issue in #product-tech.  \n2026-01-16 14:13–15:18 – Investigation starts; we identify Kafka topic lag delaying fraud responses and thus payment completion.  \n2026-01-16 15:27+ – Deep root cause still under investigation; flow stabilized (no further ongoing incident reported).  \n2026-01-19 – Q2 requests a clear RCA and preventive action plan; we confirm we’re working on a solution and postmortem.\n\n**Corrective and Preventive Measures:**  \nReplace the current asynchronous Kafka-based integration between the Fraud and Core services with a synchronous REST API, ensuring that inter-service communication occurs in real time and is no longer affected by Kafka consumer lag.  \nPrepare and run regression and  stress tests for this new implementation.",

The impact was on data integrity and financial correctness: approximately 5,534 PicPay wallet transactions for SorteOnline were recorded as “succeeded” in Yuno/VTEX while actually expiring/refunding at PicPay (“Expired” / “Late capture” in the provider)\n\n**Detection:**  \nThe incident was detected on January 12, 2026 at 17:54 UTC, when SorteOnline reported that all PicPay wallet payments were being refunded: VTEX showed orders as “Faturado” and Yuno as “confirmed/succeeded”, while PicPay showed them as refunded or in “Late capture” status.\n\n**Response and recovery:**  \nAfter the merchant report on January 12, 2026, the Product Tech and Integrations teams opened a ticket and started a war room to investigate. They identified that the PicPay wallet flow was using the wrong capture flag (root capture instead of the wallet-specific flag), which caused authorized transactions to remain “succeeded” in Yuno while expiring/refunding at PicPay. A hotfix was developed and deployed to production at 21:11 UTC on January 12, 2026, correcting the capture flag used for PicPay wallet transactions and preventing new incorrect states. A secondary side effect impacting the Pix flow was then detected and quickly fixed the same day, with pending Pix notifications successfully reprocessed, after which the incident was considered resolved.\n\n**Corrective and Preventive Measures:**  \n\\[Done\\] Fix PicPay wallet capture flag mapping  \nAction: Update the integration to use the wallet-specific capture flag instead of the root capture flag.  \nAutoCapture changed from createRequest.Capture to createRequest.PaymentMethodRequest.Details.Wallet.Capture.  \nOwner: Integrations team  \nTarget date: 2026-01-12 (completed)\n\n\\[Done\\] Fix unintended impact on Pix notifications  \nAction: Correct the side effect the hotfix introduced on the Pix flow and reprocess pending Pix notifications.  \nOwner: Integrations team  \nTarget date: 2026-01-12 (completed)\n\n\\[Planned\\] Implement webhook retry mechanism (second incident)  \nAction: The idea is to implement a retry feature for webhooks to guarantee that messages are not lost when delivery failures occur. When an error happens (such as timeouts, network issues, or non-successful responses), the event should be sent to a queue and retried according to a defined policy.  \nOwner: Platform / Integrations team",

The deployment included a new query that accessed a non-indexed column in the database.\n\nThis query began to degrade database performance to the point where errors started occurring in the integrations. Once the errors were detected, a rollback was executed; however, since the database was already degraded, the errors persisted.\n\nThe DBA team manually created the required index and a new deployment was performed, which resolved the errors.\n\nSubsequently, a manual process was carried out to query and update the status of all payments affected during the incident window.\n\n**Root cause:**  \nA pull request introduced a query that accessed a non-indexed column in the operation table of the pagbank-int microservice, causing database performance degradation.  \n  \nTwo separate pull requests were deployed simultaneously to two different microservices (`pagbank-int` and `pagbank-webhook`) as part of a canary deployment.\n\nThe changes introduced a modification in the `reference_id` logic. Previously, `reference_id` was always mapped to `transaction_code`. With the new implementation, `reference_id` is now derived based on the `OrderID` configuration.\n\nTo support this change and achieve cleaner code, a new query was introduced that searched by `transaction_provider_id` in the operations table. However, this column was not indexed, causing significant database performance degradation under load.\n\nAdditionally, the `reference_id` was incorrectly being sent to the Core team as the `transaction_code`. The correct behavior is to send the actual `transaction_code` received in the GET response from PagBank, not the `reference_id`.\n\n**Impact:**  \nHigh\n\n**Description of the incident's impact:**  \nThe issue caused delays in up to 1,312 payments, whose webhooks were subsequently processed manually.\n\n**Detection:**  \nThe incident was detected during deployment monitoring.\n\n**Response and recovery:**  \nA call was initiated involving the DBA team to create the required index, redeploy the tag, and subsequently process the webhooks manually.\n\n**Corrective and Preventive Measures:**  \n1\\. Create primary indexes on all operations tables across all integrations.  \n2\\. Remove the operations table from integrations where it is not required.",

The issue was caused by two combined factors: (1) the feature-flag logic was deployed only to the Settings v2 endpoint used by newer SDK versions, while Petz still used a Web SDK version that consumes Settings v1, and (2) the Configuration service selected the first provider connection in the merchant’s routing, which was not the connection used for Click to Pay. As a result, the SDK received incorrect configuration and Passkeys remained disabled.\n\nA fix was deployed to replicate the feature-flag logic into Settings v1, and the merchant updated the correct provider connection parameters as a temporary workaround. The Web flow was restored the same day.\n\n**Root cause:**  \nThe incident was the result of two independent issues that combined into a functional failure:\n\nFeature flag applied only to Settings v2\n\n* A change enabling Passkeys only for Web (not Mobile) was implemented in Settings v2.\n* Petz’s Web SDK version still uses Settings v1, which did not include the new logic.\n* Therefore, the SDK received c2p_passkey_enabled: false.\n\nConfiguration service routing behavior\n\n* The merchant had two REDE provider connections.\n* The Config service selects the first connection of a provider.\n* The first connection was not the one configured for Click to Pay (C2P), so the SDK did not receive any Passkey/3DS configuration.\n\nBoth factors led the Web SDK to believe Passkeys were disabled.\n\n**Impact:**  \nLow\n\n**Description of the incident's impact:**  \nPetz’s Click to Pay Passkey flow was disabled for Web transactions during an active Mastercard campaign.\n\n**Detection:**\n\n* The incident was detected when Petz reported Passkeys not working in production.\n* Internal logs confirmed that the SDK was receiving c2p_passkey_enabled: false.\n* The discrepancy between Settings v1 and v2 became clear during the investigation.\n* Config service routing behavior was identified after comparing provider connections.\n* **Response and recovery:**  \n  The incident was detected when Petz reported Passkeys not working in production.\n* Internal logs confirmed that the SDK was receiving c2p_passkey_enabled: false.\n* The discrepancy between Settings v1 and v2 became clear during the investigation.\n* Config service routing behavior was identified after comparing provider connections.\n\n**Corrective and Preventive Measures:**  \nImmediate Fixes\n\n* Replicated Passkey feature-flag logic into Settings v1 to ensure backward compatibility with older SDK versions.\n* Ensured the Web flow correctly differentiates Web vs. Mobile Passkey activation.\n\nShort-Term Improvements\n\n* Document SDK compatibility for Settings v1/v2 and require validation across all active merchant versions.\n* Add internal checks to ensure that new feature flags or changes are validated for both v1 and v2 when applicable.\n\nLong-Term Preventive Actions\n\n* Evaluate a refactor of the Config service routing logic to avoid relying on the “first provider connection,” which can lead to configuration mismatches.\n* Promote migration paths for merchants on older SDKs to ensure compatibility with new features.\n\n",

The first internal alert on transaction volume triggered at 09:27 UTC, the partner report arrived at 09:54 UTC, a failed rollback attempt via Kingdom occurred at 10:12 UTC, a manual rollback by DevOps completed at 10:24 UTC, and error rates returned to normal by 10:35 UTC. Estimated impact duration (partner-visible): \\~41 minutes.\n\n**Root cause:**  \nA runtime panic introduced by the feature deployed to public-api. The change was not covered by load testing or validations that exercised the defective path under production-like traffic.\n\n**Impact:**  \nHigh\n\n**Description of the incident's impact:**  \nImpacted client: InDrive experienced 503 responses when calling Yuno’s API during the affected period.\n\nPayments drop: based on a reference of 25,404 payments (same weekday/time window in the previous week), 10,132 payments were executed during the incident window, representing an approximate 60% reduction.\n\nImpact window (partner-visible): 09:54–10:35 UTC (\\~41 minutes).\n\n**Detection:**  \n09:27 UTC: Internal alert triggered due to changes in transaction volume.  \n09:30 UTC: Internal alert reviewed.  \n09:54 UTC: InDrive reported 503 responses from Yuno’s API.\n\n**Response and recovery:**  \n09:57 UTC: Internal investigation started.  \n09:58 UTC: Issue escalated to the DevOps team.  \n09:59 UTC: Coordination call established.  \n10:10 UTC: The root cause was identified as a panic in the newly deployed feature.  \n10:12 UTC: Rollback attempted via Kingdom; the attempt failed.  \n10:24 UTC: DevOps executed a rollback to the previous version.  \n10:35 UTC: Error rates returned to normal.\n\n**Corrective and Preventive Measures:**  \nPre-deploy\n\n\\-Requirement: any change in public-api other than adding a new nullable field must undergo load testing. Attach evidence to the release document.  \nIn Kingdom, make it mandatory to attach or check the link of a successful load test for the collection prior to deployment.  \n\\-Investigate and standardize how to generate a hash or immutable artifact to verifiably associate a specific load test with the corresponding deployment.\n\nDeploy and Post-deploy\n\n\\-Create an internal Datadog metric/alert comparing POST /v1/payment last week vs current week to detect anomalous volume drops.  \n\\-Mandatory canary for public-api. Exceptions allowed only for heads: Juanma, Julián, Chiqui.  \n\\-Rollback improvements: create an emergency role (DevOps only) to bypass deployment restrictions and skip the PCI ticket requirement if the rollback button malfunctions.  \n\\-Monitoring links checklist associated in Kingdom for each deployment. In the single microservices monitor, add a new section for quick access to error logs to reduce ambiguity in interpretation.  \n\\-In a catastrophic scenario, ensure the recovery procedure is carried through to completion without blockers.",

        "description": "Date: 2025-12-08\n\nOwner: Nicolas Peñaloza Gamba\n\nAffected Services:    \nClick to Pay (C2P) card payments via 2C2P for Petz and potentially other Yuno merchants using this flow.\n\nSeverity:    \nHigh – Significant degradation in conversion for a core payment flow affecting live merchant campaigns and revenue.\n\nExecutive Summary:    \nStarting on Friday (BR time), Petz experienced a sharp drop in conversion on Click to Pay (C2P) card transactions, with acquirer responses such as “invalid card number” and “life cycle” on valid cards. The issue was escalated on 2025-12-08 through Jira (PFU-264/TST12-2154 context) and Slack due to its impact on Petz’s Mastercard marketing incentive campaign. Investigation correlated the degradation with a recent Click to Pay – Visa deployment. A rollback to the previous stable version was executed the same day, after which Petz’s C2P transactions began succeeding again and conversion returned to expected levels.\n\nRoot cause:    \nA defective change introduced in the most recent Click to Pay – Visa deployment for the C2P integration (version 1.1.7). The change altered request/handling logic in a way that caused the acquirer to interpret some valid cards as invalid or in an inconsistent lifecycle state, leading to “invalid card number”/“life cycle” errors and failed transactions.\n\nImpact:\n\n* Functionally: Legitimate customers could not complete purchases via C2P, receiving misleading “invalid card” style errors.\n* Operationally: Support, CS, and Engineering were engaged in urgent investigation, with ad-hoc monitoring and merchant coordination.\n* Commercially: Revenue loss during the incident window and risk to Petz’s Mastercard incentive program, with potential reputational impact for both Petz and Yuno.\n\nDescription of the incident's impact:    \nFor a subset of C2P card payments in production, valid cards that previously worked began failing consistently with acquirer error messages indicating invalid card details or lifecycle status. This behavior was observed across multiple customers/cards and impacted a non-trivial portion of Petz’s C2P checkout traffic. Customers abandoning failed transactions resulted in lost sales and undermined Petz’s active Mastercard incentive campaign. Other Yuno merchants using C2P may have also experienced similar conversion degradation during the same period.\n\nDetection:    \nThe incident was initially detected by the merchant, who observed a marked drop in C2P conversion and abnormal “invalid card number”/“life cycle” errors starting Friday. The problem was formally escalated to Yuno via a support ticket on 2025-12-08 and reinforced through Slack communications.\n\nResponse and recovery:\n\n* The issue was triaged as high priority with cross-functional engagement (Support, Integrations, Product, and leadership).\n* Engineering quickly correlated the onset of the issue with a recent Click to Pay – Visa deployment in the C2P integration.\n* A rollback to the previous stable version (1.1.6) was executed in production as a preventive mitigation.\n* Petz performed validation transactions post-rollback and confirmed that previously failing flows were now succeeding.\n* Internal monitoring confirmed that approval and conversion rates for C2P returned to expected levels, and the incident was moved into monitoring/validation status with the merchant.\n\nCorrective and Preventive Measures:\n\n* **Code-level fix and validation:**\n\n    * Fully isolate the defective change in the Click to Pay – Visa deployment and implement a robust fix.\n    * Expand automated and manual test coverage for C2P, with emphasis on card lifecycle flows, issuer/acquirer error handling, and data/field mappings.\n    \n* **Deployment safeguards:**\n\n    * Introduce or strengthen feature flags and progressive rollout strategies for critical payment flows, enabling safer canary deployments and faster, low-risk rollbacks.\n    * Require explicit risk assessment and rollback plans for changes in core provider integrations (such as C2P).\n    \n* **Monitoring and alerting improvements:**\n\n    * Implement provider- and merchant-level monitoring for conversion rates, with alerting on statistically significant drops.\n    * Add targeted alerts for surges in key acquirer error codes (e.g., “invalid card number,” lifecycle-related errors) for C2P transactions.\n    \n* **Process and communication:**\n\n    * Standardize an external incident communication template and SLAs for high-impact payment issues, especially when merchant commercial programs are at stake.\n    * Ensure Support and CS have clear runbooks to correlate merchant-reported conversion drops with recent deployments and monitoring dashboards, reducing time to detection and mitigation.\n    \n\n",

The field code was received as null and mapped to an empty string, resulting in incorrect data sent to Mercado Pago and a wave of declines. The deploy started at 11:04 UTC; the TAM team reported the incident in product-tech at 12:12 UTC; a rollback was initiated at 12:48 UTC, and by 12:54 UTC the previous version was live and errors stopped. A total of 5,650 payments were affected across Vibra and Arcos Dorados.\n\n**Root cause:**  \nPayments associated with subscription flows using the automatic PIX feature were declined by Mercado Pago due to an invalid subscription object (code missing/empty). The incident impacted clients Vibra and Arcos Dorados. From 11:04 UTC (deploy) until 12:54 UTC (rollback completed), 5,650 payments were affected, generating customer-facing declines and operational friction.\n\n**Impact:**  \nMedium\n\n**Description of the incident's impact:**  \nWith today's deployment, we began mapping a new subscription object for the wallet category. However, the Mercado Pago integration lacked validation for this object, resulting in empty data being sent and causing the provider to fail. Only that integration failed. The incident impacted clients Vibra and Arcos Dorados. From 11:04 UTC (deploy) until 12:54 UTC (rollback completed), 5,650 payments were affected, generating customer-facing declines and operational friction.\n\n**Detection:**  \nThe incident was detected when the TAM team reported payment declines in the product-tech Slack channel at 12:12 UTC.\n\n**Response and recovery:**  \nThe engineering team correlated the declines with the recent deployment and performed a rollback:\n\n11:04 UTC: Deployment started for the automatic PIX feature impacting subscription flows.  \n12:12 UTC: Incident reported by TAM in product-tech.  \n12:48 UTC: Rollback initiated.  \n12:54 UTC: Previous version restored; errors ceased.\n\n**Corrective and Preventive Measures:**  \n\\-Finish and adopt the 1% canary rollout capability for the Core team to limit blast radius on initial releases.  \n\\-Do not send objects with null critical fields from Core services to the gateway (omit the object or enforce validation instead of serializing null/empty required fields).  \n\\-Run targeted regression suites for the most highly concurrent/critical providers before production deploys.  \n\\-Improve the deployment template with a mandatory post-deploy checklist, including the specific dashboards and signals that must be validated after each release.",

The refresh endpoint returned an error that was not properly handled, causing the system to overwrite merchant connection credentials with empty values. This resulted in transactional failures for affected merchants until a database rollback was performed.\n\n**Root cause:**  \nThe Yuno credentials (X CLIENT ID and X CLIENT SECRET) provided by PagBank for the OAuth2 token refresh process had become obsolete/deprecated. When the automated renewal flow attempted to call the PagBank endpoint ([https://api.pagseguro.com/oauth2/refresh](https://api.pagseguro.com/oauth2/refresh)), the API returned an error:   \n{  \n\"error_messages\": \\[  \n{  \n\"code\": \"41012\",  \n\"description\": \"token_is_no_longer_active\",  \n\"parameter_name\": \"access_token\"  \n}  \n\\]  \n}  \nThe renewal flow lacked proper error handling for this scenario. As a result, the unmarshalling of the error response produced zero values, which were then used to update the merchant connections, overwriting valid Token and Refresh Token values with empty strings.\n\n**Impact:**  \nHigh\n\n**Description of the incident's impact:**  \nAvailability: Merchants with PagBank connections were unable to process transactions, as the empty Token value was sent as credential in transactional requests\n\n**Detection:**  \nDetected by tams and ops team\n\n**Response and recovery:**  \nThe incident was identified and a database snapshot rollback was executed to restore the merchant connections to their previous valid state.

        "description": "**Date:**   \n2025-06-26\n\n**Owner:**  \nintegrations\n\n**Affected Services:**  \nxendit-int \n\n**Affected Clients:**  \nInDrive\n\n**Total incident impact time (in seconds):**  \n24.000\n\n**Total number of affected transactions:**  \n87770 notifications of transactions\n\n**Severity:**  \nS1 - High\n\n## **Executive Summary**\n\n  \nOn November 26, 2025, a deployment was released to integrate a new payment method for Xendit (DANA), requested urgently by INDRIVE. Due to time pressure from the TAM team and with documented approval from Yuno leadership, the deployment bypassed QA validation with the agreement that verification would occur in production.\n\nThe deployment introduced outdated version of the Chi router library (v1.x.x), which affected 100% of asynchronous Xendit transactions. Notifications to merchants failed silently, leaving approximately **18,680 transactions in a pending state** over a period of nearly **19 hours**.\n\nThe incident was first reported by the TAM team at 00:58 UTC on November 27 (based on merchant complaints), but was triaged as low priority. The issue was not fully investigated until the following business day. Once the correlation with the deployment was established, an immediate rollback was executed, and affected transactions were re-notified successfully.\n\n**Key contributing factors:**\n\n* Deployment approved without QA validation\n* Automated regression warnings were ignored\n* Opsgenie alerts for the affected microservice were disabled\n* Low-priority triage despite recent deployment\n* No post-deployment monitoring performed by the developer\n\n‌\n\n## Timeline (All times in UTC)\n\n‌\n\n| **Time** | **Event** |\n| --- | --- |\n| Nov 26, 20:06 | Deployment initiated with 1% canary rollout, incrementing every 10 minutes |\n| Nov 26, 20:20 | First traffic routed through new version; async notification failures begin |\n| Nov 27, \\~00:58 | TAM team reports some transactions stuck in pending state (ticket raised as **low priority**) |\n| Nov 27, 03:30 | Canary reaches 100% (estimated based on rollout schedule) |\n| Nov 27, \\~03:30-06:00 | Night hours (low traffic); on-call team in India not engaged |\n| Nov 27, \\~12:00 | Engineering team begins business day, reviews ticket |\n| Nov 27, 15:15 | **Rollback executed**; stable version restored |\n| Nov 27, 16:00 | Root cause identified: Chi library incompatibility in deployed version |\n| Nov 28, 19:29 | Re-notification process initiated for affected transactions |\n| Nov 29, 01:04 | All pending transactions successfully notified; incident resolved |\n\n‌\n\n## **Root Cause**\n\n  \nUsing Chi library version **v1.x.x** was a mistake, as this release line contains known issues and limitations. The project should have been updated to **v5**, the current and stable major version, which includes important fixes, improvements, and full compatibility with modern Go modules.\n\n## **Impact**\n\n  \nQuantitative Impact\n\n* **Transactions affected:** \\~18,680\n* **Primary merchant affected:** INDRIVE\n* **Other merchants affected:** All merchants using Xendit async payment methods\n* **Transaction state:** Pending (not lost; successfully reconciled post-rollback)\n* **Data consistency:** Maintained on Yuno side; temporary inconsistency on merchant side\n\n## Business Impact\n\n* Merchants did not receive webhook notifications for completed/failed transactions\n* Merchant dashboards showed transactions stuck in pending state\n* Potential customer support escalations on merchant side\n* Degraded trust with INDRIVE (the merchant who requested the urgent feature)\n\n‌\n\n## Root Cause Analysis\n\n### Technical Root Cause\n\nThe deployment included the Chi router library at version **v1.x.x**, which contains known issues with asynchronous route handling and middleware execution. This version is deprecated and incompatible with modern Go module conventions.\n\nThe library issue caused webhook notification handlers to fail silently, preventing outbound notifications to merchants while transactions processed normally on Yuno's side.\n\n‌\n\n## Process Root Causes\n\n* **QA Bypass:** The deployment was approved without QA validation due to business urgency. While this was a documented decision approved by leadership, no alternative verification mechanism was enforced.\n* **Ignored Regression Signals:** Automated regression tests showed degradation, but these warnings were dismissed by the developer. The CI/CD pipeline allowed the deployment to proceed despite failing checks.\n* **Disabled Alerting:** Opsgenie alerts for the xendit-integration microservice were disabled at the time of the incident. The reason for this is under investigation.\n* **Inadequate Triage:** The TAM report was raised as low priority because only a small percentage of transactions were initially affected (due to canary rollout). There was no correlation made with the recent deployment.\n* **No Post-Deployment Monitoring:** The developer did not perform the expected post-deployment monitoring or provide evidence of system health after release.\n* **On-Call Gap:** Despite having an on-call team in India covering night hours for the Americas, the team was not engaged due to the low-priority classification of the ticket.\n\n## Lessons Learned\n\n1. **Urgency is not a reason to skip safety checks** — The feature was urgent for the merchant, but the resulting incident caused more damage than a delayed release would have.\n2. **Disabled alerts are invisible risks** — There was no visibility into the fact that critical alerts were turned off.\n3. **Canary rollouts can mask severity** — Low initial impact during canary created false confidence and led to low-priority triage.\n4. **Regression warnings exist for a reason** — Ignoring automated test failures defeats the purpose of having them.\n5. **Post-deployment monitoring is non-negotiable** — The developer's responsibility extends beyond merging code.\n6. Avoid leaving changes in QA for extended periods  \n  Keeping a pull request with a new payment method open in QA for 20 days led to outdated code, loss of context, and increased risk. QA cycles should remain short, and PRs should not remain idle for long.\n7. Do not use release candidates in production for QA purposes  \n  Deploying a release candidate to production in order to run QA — despite it being identified as a bad practice — introduced unnecessary risk. Validation must be completed in non-production environments before any production deployment\n8. Avoid keeping release candidates in sandbox without QA for several days  \n  Leaving a release candidate in the sandbox for an extended period without testing created delays and reduced visibility into potential issues. QA should begin promptly after the RC is available.\n9. Manage pressure for rapid production deployments, especially during on-call periods  \n  Rushing a deployment to production while handling high-severity on-call issues increased stress and the likelihood of mistakes. Deployment decisions should consider team workload and incident context to maintain quality and safety.\n10. Avoid late-day deployments without monitoring  \n  Deploying at 5 PM without proper monitoring coverage reduced the ability to detect or respond to issues quickly. Deployments should be planned within support hours and with active monitoring to ensure a rapid response if needed.\n\n## Corrective and Preventive Actions\n\n‌\n\n* **Implement deployment-aware alert escalation:** Any ticket reported within 24h of a deployment should auto-escalate to P2 minimum\n* **Chi v5 migration plan:** Inventory all microservices using Chi v1.x.x and create prioritized migration roadmap\n* **QA capacity review:** Address dev-to-QA ratio imbalance; evaluate automated testing expansion as alternative\n* **Expedited release process redesign:** Create a formal \"fast-track\" release process that includes minimal automated checks instead of full QA bypass\n* Implement regression tests (manual or automated) for all flows related to notifications, asynchronous operations, and third-party payment providers to detect breaking changes early. with QA approval.\n* Remind the engineering team of the importance of following the release process, especially regarding regression warnings and QA steps. Reinforce accountability when steps are skipped.\n* Enforce a policy prohibiting QA activities in production\n* Improve deployment decision-making under high-pressure or on-call scenarios\n* Send to High priorty to on schedulle  integrations team the alarms\n* send notification when an alarm is  off  in any integration  \n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n‌\n\n## Open Questions\n\n1. Why were Opsgenie alerts disabled for xendit-integration? When were they disabled and by whom?\n2. Should we implement a \"deployment freeze\" policy for urgent merchant requests until proper validation is possible?\n3. How do we balance business urgency with release safety without creating bottlenecks?\n4. Should the on-call team in India have explicit instructions to escalate any issues occurring within 24h of a deployment5\n5. why tam send this request for low priority?.\n\n",

This caused transient connection errors and impacted approximately 488 payment requests that relied on Redis lookups during that window. The issue was quickly detected through automatic Datadog alerts and mitigated by rolling back the configuration and re-establishing stable service mesh listeners.\n\n**Root cause:**  \nThe root cause was a live configuration change applied to the service mesh control plane, which triggered a reload of the network listeners in the sidecar proxies. Redis connections operate over long-lived TCP sessions, unlike short-lived HTTP/gRPC connections. When the proxies reloaded their listeners, these persistent TCP sessions were closed without automatic retry at the protocol level. As a result, application-side Redis client connection pools (based on Lettuce/Redisson) attempted to reuse connections that had been silently terminated, leading to errors such as “Connection is closed”.  \nThis behavior does not typically affect most HTTP-based workloads because those rely on short-lived requests with built-in retries, which is why the issue was isolated to Redis-dependent workflows.\n\n**Impact:**  \nHigh\n\n**Description of the incident's impact:**  \nApproximately 488 payment processing operations were affected during the connection disruption window. Impacted requests either failed or experienced retry delays, depending on the client’s retry logic. No data loss occurred, and all affected payments were reconciled and validated once service stability was restored. Other services relying primarily on short-lived HTTP-based communication were not affected.\n\n**Detection:**  \nThe incident was detected via automated Datadog monitoring alerts, specifically elevated Redis connection error rates and increased payment failure signals. The alerts triggered immediate investigation by the on-call engineer.\n\n**Response and recovery:**  \nThe team quickly identified the link between the telemetry configuration update and the unexpected termination of persistent Redis connections. The configuration change was rolled back, and proxy listeners were allowed to stabilize. Redis connection pools were flushed and re-initialized to ensure clean and valid TCP sessions.  \nFollowing mitigation, the team reviewed connection management behavior for persistent TCP services and documented new deployment safeguards to avoid live listener reloads affecting stateful connections in future changes.\n\n**Corrective and Preventive Measures:**  \nAvoid live telemetry configuration changes  \nFuture updates to service mesh telemetry and listener configurations will not be applied in live production environments. Any changes that may trigger proxy listener reloads will require a controlled deployment rollout to prevent termination of long-lived TCP connections.\n\nPre-deployment load testing in lower environments  \nA reproducible test case has already been validated in non-production clusters. Going forward, all changes that may influence connection lifecycle, TCP handling, or proxy behavior will undergo structured load and resilience testing in lower environments before being approved for production rollout.\n\nApplication-level exception handling to protect payment continuity  \nMicroservices interacting with Redis will implement improved exception handling and connection validation logic to ensure failed Redis operations are retried gracefully without losing payment processing state. This ensures that even if a connection drop occurs, the payment flow can continue or recover without manual intervention.",

        "description": "‌\n\n**Date:**  \n2025-11-06\n\n**Owner:**  \nai-platform\n\n**Affected Services:**  \nai-assistant-ms, ai-coms-ms\n\n**Affected Clients:**  \nNot applicable (potential internal data exposure vulnerability, no direct client-facing transactional impact).\n\n**Total incident impact time (in seconds):**  \n10,368,000 (Vulnerability window: July 9, 2025 - November 6, 2025)\n\n**Total number of affected transactions:**  \nNot applicable.\n\n**Severity:**  \nS1 - Critical Security\n\n**Executive Summary:**  \nOn November 6, 2025, a critical security vulnerability was discovered where the WhatsApp agent for declined payments had unrestricted access to all internal Yuno tools since its integration into the agent system on July 9, 2025. The issue was caused by a configuration oversight. An immediate hotfix was deployed via an environment variable to restrict the agent's tool access to a minimal set, mitigating the risk. A permanent code fix is pending to correctly configure the required tools while maintaining security posture.\n\n**Root cause:**  \nWhen the `declined_payments` origin was added to `ROBERTITO_AGENT_ORIGINS`, the corresponding tool access restrictions were not configured in `ROBERTITO_JR_TOOLS_BY_ORIGIN`. The system defaulted to providing the agent with all available internal tools, violating the principle of least privilege.  \n  \nGitHub Issue: <custom data-type=\"smartlink\" data-id=\"id-0\">https://github.com/yuno-payments/ai-assistant-ms/commit/61d50d5994591400548b0db1f3f7deaef8982055</custom> \n\n**Impact:**  \nHigh\n\n**Description of the incident's impact:**  \nThe vulnerability exposed internal Yuno operational tools (`payment_details_expert`, `webhook_information_expert`, `logs_information_expert`, etc.) to a customer-facing WhatsApp agent. While no evidence of malicious use has been found, this created a significant risk of internal data exposure through the agent's conversational capabilities.\n\n**Detection:**  \nDiscovered during a routine AI agent capability review and security analysis by the development team.\n\n**Response and recovery:**  \nUpon discovery, a temporary hotfix was immediately deployed by updating the `ROBERTITO_JR_TOOLS_BY_ORIGIN` environment variable to restrict the `declined_payments` agent to only the `reasoning_step` tool. This immediately removed the over-privileged access and mitigated the vulnerability in the production environment.\n\n**Corrective and Preventive Measures:**\n\n1. Implement a permanent code fix to correctly configure the minimal required tool access for any new origin. And in particular for the `declined_payments` origin add (`get_call_info_by_order_id`).\n2. Establish a mandatory security review process for any changes to agent origins or tool configurations. PR template must have a review element to check  new origin and tools access per origin.\n3. Add automated tests to verify that agents for specific origins only have access to their explicitly defined toolset, failing the build if an origin defaults to an unrestricted toolset.\n4. Audit of logs was done by Secops, non privacy information leaks were found.\n\n",

During execution, the script caused performance degradation in the customer-payment-method-ms service, resulting in high database latency. This led to 1,280 failed payments (HTTP 503 errors) within one minute on the public-api. Once the script was stopped, the errors ceased immediately.\n\n**Root cause:**  \nThe root cause was the execution of a massive script that generated a high number of concurrent requests to the customer-payment-method-ms service without proper throttling or load control. The high concurrency overwhelmed the database and service resources, leading to increased latency and failed API responses.\n\n**Impact:**  \nHigh\n\n**Description of the incident's impact:**  \nThe script overloaded the database and downstream services used by the customer-payment-method-ms, causing a brief period where payment transactions with enrolled methods could not be processed successfully. Other merchants and services were not affected.\n\n**Detection:**  \nThe issue was detected through error spikes in the monitoring system, showing a sudden increase in HTTP 503 responses. Once identified, the script execution was stopped manually to prevent further impact.\n\n**Response and recovery:**  \nThe engineering team promptly halted the script execution, which immediately stabilized the customer-payment-method-ms service and reduced database latency. No rollback was required since the impact was operational, not code-related.\n\n**Corrective and Preventive Measures:**  \nCode Review Requirement: All future scripts designed to execute mass requests must undergo a peer code review before execution.\n\nSupervised Execution: Scripts that impact production environments must be executed under supervision with at least one additional developer present.\n\nLoad Testing & Throttling: Introduce throttling mechanisms and pre-validation of batch sizes before running large-scale scripts.\n\nMonitoring Improvements: Implement specific alerts to detect abnormal latency increases or request spikes in customer-payment-method-ms.\n\nIncluir the rate limit in internal services",

After 14,666 failed retries over six hours, the issue was reported by the merchant. A rollback was executed immediately, and a fix was developed and deployed the following morning.  \n\nAdditionally, secondary errors occurred in the **network token service**, leading to some payments remaining in **Created** status due to improper error handler management.\n\n---\n\n### **Root Cause**\n\nThe main issue was caused by an incompatibility introduced in the deployment affecting the retry logic of the custom OAuth2 authentication used by Petz.  \nA secondary contributing factor was a mismanaged error handler in the **network token service**, which failed to properly update payment states when downstream errors occurred.\n\n---\n\n### **Impact**\n\nMedium\n\n---\n\n### **Description of the Incident's Impact**\n\nThe incident resulted in **14,666 failed authentication retries** over a period of six hours, impacting Petz’s ability to complete payment operations during that window.  \nIn addition, **some payments (6881) remained in Created status** instead of progressing through the normal processing flow, caused by the improper handling of errors in the **network token service**.\n\n---\n\n### **Detection**\n\nThe problem was reported by the merchant (**Petz**) after observing abnormal authentication behavior. There were no prior automated alerts or monitoring triggers for this specific scenario.\n\nThe Network token problem was detected because we started having timeout errors due to latency in the database.\n\n---\n\n### **Response and Recovery**\n\nOnce reported, the engineering team performed an immediate rollback to restore normal functionality. A root cause analysis was conducted, a fix was implemented, and the corrected version was successfully redeployed the following morning.\n\nSubsequently, additional fixes were applied to the **network token handler** to ensure proper state transitions and error handling during downstream failures.\n\n---\n\n### **Corrective and Preventive Measures**\n\n* Implemented a fix to ensure proper handling of the custom OAuth2 retry flow.\n* Corrected error handling logic in the **network token service** to prevent payments from remaining in Created state.\n* Improved the test coverage for merchants using custom authentication implementations.\n* Recommended that the NOC team add a specific alert for abnormal increases in authentication retries.\n* Strengthened pre-deployment validation steps for custom integrations.\n* Review the indexes we have in the database\n* Add an alert to the Yuno dashboard\n\n",

Due to the effort involved in making this change across all microservices, it was decided to fill all empty fields with “N/A” and, in Stripe, to remove them entirely. When removed, the field became null, whereas in the current implementation, missing fields were being sent as empty strings. This difference caused all transactions with missing parameters to fail with a “missing parameters” error when the deployment went live in PROD. Once the TAM/KAM team reported the incident, and after analysis, a rollback was performed to restore normal traffic.\n\n**Root cause:**  \nA PROD deployment that modified the default behavior for parameters in Stripe’s billing-address object. \n\n**Impact:**  \nHigh\n\n**Description of the incident's impact:**  \nWhile the new tag was active in PROD, approximately 3,531 transactions failed in Stripe. \n\n**Detection:**  \nThe TAM/KAM team reported it via #product-tech. \n\n**Response and recovery:**  \nOnce the incident was identified as related to the deployment, a rollback was executed. \n\n**Corrective and Preventive Measures:**  \nA new dashboard was added to the deployment procedure to monitor the conversion rate.  \nA new deployment scheme was introduced with a canary release and a ramp-up of more than 10 hours to detect any incident with only a small portion of the traffic.

The root cause was that the payment method was not enabled in the production environment. This issue did not affect any real transactions, as the merchant was only performing tests.\n\nThe main impact was reputational: the merchant attempted to test the new payment method and encountered a non-functional setup. The problem occurred because the payment method had been correctly enabled in lower environments, but the production deployment step was missed.\n\n**Root cause:**  \nConfiguration oversight: The Yape payment method was enabled in staging and other lower environments, but was not activated in production.\n\n**Impact:**  \nLow\n\n**Description of the incident's impact:**\n\n* Merchant (JetSmart): Inconvenience during testing, creating a perception of a non-functional integration.\n* Transactions: None were affected, as the payment method is new and no real payments had been processed yet.\n* Internal teams: Minimal impact; the issue was identified and resolved quickly once reported.\n\n  \n  \n**Detection:**\n\n* Initial report: JetSmart noticed the Yape payment method was not available in production and reported the issue.\n* Investigation: The integrations team confirmed that the payment method was correctly configured in lower environments but not enabled in production.\n* Root cause identification: Verified production configuration and confirmed the payment method was missing from Routing\n\n**Response and recovery:**  \nActions Taken:\n\n* Enabled the Yape payment method in production.\n* Verified that the connection appeared correctly in Routing and was functional for testing.\n\n**Recovery Time**: <1 hour from detection to resolution.\n\n**Corrective and Preventive Measures:**  \nCorrective Actions (Implemented):  \n✔️ Enabled the missing payment method in production.  \n✔️ Verified functionality in Routing.\n\n**Preventive Measures (To be Implemented):**\n\nUpdate Deployment Checklist\n\n* Action: Include verification of newly added payment methods in production.\n* Owner: Integrations Team\n* Justification: Prevent similar oversights in the future.\n\nInternal Communication\n\n* Action: Communicate deployment steps and responsibilities for new payment methods to relevant teams.\n* Owner: Integrations Team\n* Justification: Reduce human error during deployment.\n\n**Lessons Learned**\n\n* Even low-impact issues can affect merchant perception and trust.\n* Deployment processes must include verification for all new configurations, including non-transactional environments.\n* Automated checks can reduce reliance on manual verification and prevent similar incidents.\n\n",

The logic indicated that if the 3DS ECI was 00 and the cryptogram was empty, the three_d_secure_mode field should be sent with a mandatory value, so that MercadoPago (MP) would be responsible for validating the 3DS.\n\nThe problem was that, when this condition was met in McDonald's transactions, MP did not have support to validate 3DS in that flow, which caused the reported error.",

Since the object did not contain the complete data, MercadoPago began to decline those payments. Once the incident was identified, a rollback was performed at 2:38 PM GMT, after which payments were once again processed correctly.\n\n**Root cause:**  \nA change made in the mapping of an object only affected one provider. Since core changes do not trigger tests for all providers, this error was not detected during testing and made it to PROD.\n\n**Impact:**  \nHigh\n\n**Description of the incident's impact:**  \nMore than 11,000 transactions from a very critical client were affected.\n\n**Detection:**  \nReported by the merchant to the TAM team, escalated by TAM to the tech team.\n\n**Response and recovery:**  \nThe modified mapping that was causing the issue was identified. That code was removed, a new commit was pushed, tested in STG, and once it was verified to work correctly, it was deployed to PROD using canary.\n\n**Corrective and Preventive Measures:**  \n1\\. New dashboard to monitor approval rate by provider at the moment of deploying in core.  \n2\\. Evaluate the entire deployment flow and propose changes to the deployment schedule.",

        "description": "**Date:**   \n2025-08-14\n\n**Owner:**  \nintegrations\n\n**Affected Services:**  \nDlocal-int\n\n**Affected Clientes:**  \nRappi\n\n**Total incident impact time (in seconds):**  \n1,900,800 seconds (approximately 22 days). This period corresponds to the time during which the version with the incorrect configuration was deployed. The issue was not automatically detected by our monitoring systems because timeouts occur sporadically (refunds are not executed constantly), and we don’t have specific alerts for duplicate transactions. This explains why the problem was not identified proactively.\n\n**Total number of affected transactions:**  \nWe don’t have the exact number of affected transactions. The transactions were handled internally by the provider (dLocal) and were later processed successfully, so we don’t have precise metrics. The team also doesn’t have the exact number.Only for mobile:\n\n* Affected versions: v2.56.0\n* Fix version: v2.60.1\n\n**Severity:**  \nS3 - Medium Severity\n\n**Executive Summary:**  \nDuring the analyzed period, an unintended modification to the timeout configuration for dLocal card refunds reduced the time limit to 30 seconds. This configuration caused refund requests taking longer than 30 seconds to be marked as “declined” on Yuno’s side, while dLocal continued processing them successfully in the background.  \nThis inconsistency in statuses triggered the automatic retry system (simplified_mode) to issue new refund attempts, creating duplicate transactions in dLocal’s system. However, thanks to dLocal’s internal controls, these duplicates were automatically handled without any real impact on customers or merchants.  \nThe issue was detected when Rappi reported duplicate refund attempts in their transactions. After investigation, the erroneous configuration change was identified and reverted, restoring the system to normal operation.\n\n**Root cause:**  \nThe root cause of the incident was an accidental modification to the refund timeout configuration for dLocal during a Pull Request. Specifically:\n\n* **Unintended change**: A PR reduced the refund timeout for dLocal to 30 seconds. Previously, the timeout value was higher, which allowed dLocal to complete its processes normally.\n* **Lack of visibility**: This change went unnoticed during the code review process because there were no unit tests in place to validate this critical configuration.\n* **Nature of the issue**: A 30-second timeout is not immediately obvious as problematic, since many dLocal transactions complete within that timeframe. However, a significant portion requires longer to be processed successfully.\n\n**Impact:**  \nMedium\n\n**Description of the incident's impact:**  \nThe incident caused state inconsistencies between Yuno and dLocal, specifically affecting full refunds for the merchant **Rappi**. The problematic flow unfolded as follows:\n\n* **Timeout in Yuno**: When dLocal took more than 30 seconds to respond, Yuno terminated the connection and marked the refund as _\"declined.\"_\n* **Ongoing processing in dLocal**: Despite the timeout, dLocal continued processing the refund and successfully completed it.\n* **Automatic retry**: Yuno’s `simplified_mode` system, seeing the refund marked as _\"declined,\"_ triggered an automatic retry.\n* **Duplicate processing**: dLocal received and processed this second attempt, resulting in duplicate refund transactions in its system.\n\n**Real Impact on Stakeholders:**\n\n* **End customers**: No impact. dLocal’s internal controls prevented customers from receiving actual duplicate refunds.\n* **Merchant (Rappi)**: Observed duplicate refund attempts in their reports, causing operational confusion but no financial impact.\n* **Support team**: Increase in reported cases related to “duplicate” refunds.\n* **Internal systems**: State inconsistencies that required investigation and correction.\n\n**Important note**: All reviewed cases corresponded to full refunds, so there were no actual over-refunds. However, if partial refunds had occurred under these conditions, they could have resulted in real financial impact.\n\n**Detection:**\n\n* **Initial report**: The merchant Rappi contacted the support team reporting duplicate refunds observed in their transactions.\n* **Escalation**: The support team confirmed the anomaly and escalated the case to the engineering team for technical investigation.\n* **Technical investigation**: The on-call engineer (you) started the investigation by reviewing DataDog logs and identified multiple timeout errors in dLocal transactions.\n* **Root cause identification**: A review of the change history revealed that the timeout configuration had been inadvertently modified in a recent PR.\n* **Confirmation**: It was validated that the configuration change was indeed the root cause of the observed behavior.\n\n**Detection Time**  \nThe issue was not automatically detected by monitoring systems, as timeouts are relatively sporadic events and we do not have specific alerts for duplicate transactions.\n\n**Response and recovery:**  \n**Actions Taken:**\n\n* **Rapid identification**: Once the issue was reported, the engineering team identified the root cause on the same day through log analysis and review of recent PRs.\n* **Configuration rollback**: The timeout configuration was immediately reverted, restoring the original value for dLocal refunds.\n* **Fix deployment**: The correction was deployed to production, restoring normal system behavior.\n* **Coordination with dLocal**: dLocal internally managed the cleanup of duplicate transactions generated during the incident, without requiring additional intervention from Yuno.\n* **Validation**: It was confirmed that new refund transactions worked correctly with the restored configuration.\n\n**Recovery Time**  \nOnce the root cause was identified, the correction and deployment were completed on the same day as the report.\n\n### **Corrective and Preventive Measures**\n\n**Corrective Actions (Implemented):**  \n✔️ Rollback of the timeout configuration change  \n✔️ Deployment of the correction in production  \n✔️ Validation of normal operation post-fix\n\n**Preventive Measures (To be Implemented):**\n\n1. **Implement Unit Tests for Server Configurations**\n\n    * **Action**: Add unit tests for the refunds server to validate timeout configurations, preventing unintended modifications.\n    * **Owner**: Integrations Team\n    * **Justification**: Prevent accidental changes to critical configurations from going unnoticed.\n    \n2. **Strengthen Code Reviews for Configurations**\n\n    * **Action**: Reinforce the code review process specifically for changes related to configurations in critical payment flows.\n    * **Owner**: Tech Leads + Integrations Team\n    * **Justification**: Ensure greater scrutiny of changes that affect sensitive configurations.\n    \n3. **Add Automated Tests for Timeout Configuration Validation**\n\n    * **Action**: Implement automated tests that specifically validate timeout configuration values.\n    * **Owner**: Integrations Team\n    * **Justification**: Automatically detect incorrect configurations before deployment.\n    \n4. **Improve Monitoring and Alerts**\n\n    * **Action**: Implement proactive monitoring and alerts to detect anomalies in refund processing.\n    * **Owner**: Integrations + SRE Teams\n    * **Justification**: Enable early detection of similar issues.\n    \n5. **Implement Configuration Change Checklist**\n\n    * **Action**: Create a verification checklist to prevent similar issues in future configuration changes.\n    * **Owner**: Integrations Team\n    * **Justification**: Standardize the validation process for critical changes.\n    \n\n**Lessons Learned**\n\n* **Importance of configuration tests**: Critical configurations must be protected by unit tests to prevent accidental modifications.\n* **Problem detection**: Timeout and duplication issues are difficult to detect automatically due to their sporadic nature.\n* **Coordination with providers**: Providers like dLocal have their own protection mechanisms that can mitigate the impact of our errors.\n* **Visibility in reviews**: Seemingly minor configuration changes can have significant impacts in production.\n\n",

The integration was sending cardholder names without proper sanitization (e.g., \"Foo      Bar\" instead of \"Foo Bar\"), violating PagSeguro's API requirement that words must be separated by exactly ONE space. This resulted in rejected transactions for affected merchants.\n\n**Root cause:**  \nRoot Cause: The PagSeguro integration implementation did not include input sanitization for the cardholder name field. The code was passing the cardholder value directly as received from the client without applying the required formatting rules specified in PagSeguro's documentation. Specifically, the implementation failed to normalize multiple consecutive spaces into single spaces, causing the payment provider to reject transactions when cardholder names contained extra whitespace between words.\n\n**Impact:**  \nMedium\n\n**Description of the incident's impact:**  \nThe incident had minimal impact across all security dimensions. There was no confidentiality breach or data exposure, and data integrity remained intact with transactions being either successfully processed or cleanly rejected. While the bug caused minor availability issues for a small subset of transactions (those with multiple spaces in cardholder names), the service remained fully operational for the vast majority of users.\n\n**Detection:**  \nThe issue was identified by TAM Christian Gascon through a support issue raised in Slack, where merchants reported failed transactions when processing payments through PagSeguro.\n\n**Response and recovery:**  \nImplemented cardholder name sanitization logic to normalize multiple spaces into single spaces before sending to PagSeguro's API. The fix was tested in staging environment and deployed to production during the next available deployment window. Post-deployment monitoring confirmed successful transaction processing for previously failing cases.\n\n**Corrective and Preventive Measures:**  \nCreate integration validation checklist: Develop a standard checklist for payment provider integrations that includes verifying all field validation requirements from API documentation.",

        "description": "Early this morning, an attempt was made to update Prosa certificates that were about to expire. To perform the update, it was necessary to delete the existing **secret** and recreate it with the values of the new certificate. When loading the new certificates, the following error occurred:\n\n![](blob:https://media.staging.atl-paas.net/?type=file&localId=null&id=8113fbb1-1484-46ba-af49-2f16e8a17c62&&collection=&height=54&occurrenceKey=null&width=480&__contextId=null&__displayType=null&__external=false&__fileMimeType=null&__fileName=null&__fileSize=null&__mediaTraceId=null&url=null)\nThis error prevented the creation of the new secret. Fortunately, the system kept the current certificates in memory, so as long as the pods were not restarted or drained, the service continued to function without interruption. The DevOps channel was contacted to request support in removing the secret. However, because it was in the early hours of the morning, immediate support was not received and assistance was not provided until the morning. At **8:30 a.m**., one of the pods automatically restarted, causing a connection interruption with the following message:\n\n```\ntls: failed to verify certificate: x509: certificate signed by unknown authority\n```\n\nThis meant that the pod could not read the connection certificate. Once the problem was detected, it was escalated again to the DevOps channel so that they could clean up the secret. Subsequently, the new certificate was uploaded and the pods were restarted in a controlled manner. This allowed everyone to connect correctly with the new certificate, restoring the system's transactionality to normal.",

However, Excel automatically converted these values into **0, 1, 3, 5**, and these incorrect values were later used in development for the mapping logic.\n\nAs a result, approved payments with status **00** were incorrectly mapped to **Unknown error**.\n\n* The **first fix** was applied partially, focusing only on correcting the mapping of the **ProcessorResponseCode** field where the error originated.\n* The **second fix** completed the solution by reintroducing the leading zero for all affected statuses (**00, 01, 03, 05**, etc.).\n\nThis issue caused some merchants’ approved payments to be incorrectly classified as **Unknown error**.",

Upon reviewing logs, it was detected that the response from the getPaymentByCheckoutSession service did not include the “UI” object, which is required to render the copies, QR code, and expiration timer.\n\nAfter consulting with the Backend team, it was discovered that this feature had not been enabled in Production (although it was active in Staging). Due to the progressive rollout of SDK version 2.2.2, some PIX payment transactions on iOS were affected during the week, representing 7.22% of the total PIX transactions on iOS for the period.\n\n**Root cause:**  \nLack of alerts: No monitoring in place to automatically detect the payment method failure.\n\n**Impact:**  \nMedium\n\n**Description of the incident's impact:**  \nAffected Users:  \nMerchants processing PIX payments on iOS (SDK 2.2.2, and from version 2.0.0 onwards)  \nTotal Arcos-PIX transactions in the period: 295,120 (all statuses)  \nTransactions affected by the incident: 21,320 (7.22% of the total for the period)  \nDuration: 8 days until correction\n\nFunctional Impact:  \niOS: PIX unavailable for users with the affected SDK version. (SDK 2.2.2, and from version 2.0.0 onwards)\n\n**Detection:**  \nAugust 15 (T0): Arcos reports that the QR screen does not load on iOS.  \nAugust 15 (T+5m): iOS guard detects that the “UI” object is not received in the API.\n\n**Response and recovery:**\n\n* August 15 (T+20m): Backend consulted → confirms the feature was not enabled in Production.\n* August 15 (T+40m): Feature enabled in Production → iOS functionality immediately restored. \n* No new iOS version release required → merchant did not need to take any action.\n\n**Corrective and Preventive Measures:**  \nResolution :\n\n* Backend enabled the feature in Production immediately → PIX on iOS started working again.\n\nPreventive Actions and Improvement Plan: \n\n* Configure automatic alarms to detect failures or absence of critical responses (e.g., missing “UI” object).\n\n",

A unique index must be created internally:  \nCREATE UNIQUE INDEX CONCURRENTLY IF NOT EXISTS unique_transaction_code_status ON transactions(transaction_code, status);  \nSince the memory parameters were adjusted for the session to be more efficient and for a shorter process, the Aurora instance of microservices1 eventually failed after a few minutes due to memory allocation. It was automatically restarted, losing connectivity to the microservices associated with this instance for 8 seconds, 10:35:05 UTC - 10:35:13.  \nIt is important to clarify that this process was previously carried out in the rest of the environments without problems, given the very limited number of rows.  \nAt the microservices level we see that we have the first impact on payment-rx-orc at 10:34:45 UTC and it recovers at 10:35:15 UTC.\n\nRemember that on the same RDS we have the following databases and they end up affected: \n\nchargeback-ms-postgres-master  \ncheckout-ms-postgres-master  \ncheckout-orc-postgres-master  \ncheckout-sdk-orc-postgres-master  \ncheckout-session-ms-postgres-master  \ncustomer-event-orc-postgres-master  \ncustomer-ms-postgres-master  \ncustomer-orc-postgres-master  \ncustomer-payment-method-ms-postgres-master  \ncustomer-session-ms-postgres-master  \npayment-orc-postgres-master  \npayment-rx-orc-postgres-master  \nrouting-monitor-ms-postgres-master  \nrouting-ms-postgres-master  \nrouting-orc-postgres-master\n\n**Root cause:**  \nAurora cluster was OOM to accept incoming queries due to the index creation.\n\n**Impact:**  \nHigh\n\n**Description of the incident's impact:**  \n\\~153 transactions were affected in this process. \n\n**Detection:**  \nThe issue happened in a war-room created specifically to create this index. Everyone was watching and hands on.\n\n**Response and recovery:**  \nImmediate response. The issue lasted \\~45 seconds. After the instance reboot, everything came back to normal.\n\n‌\n\n**Corrective and Preventive Measures:**\n\n1\\. Suppress any extraordinary memory resource allocation changes over the session. \n\n2\\. Provision a copy of the RDS to have the same sizing and evaluate the activity behavior in a pseudo-similar scenario.\n\n3. This payments have to be reversed:  \n\n",

This caused all Blik transactions to be rejected until the issue was fixed.\n\n**Root cause:**  \nThe change added mandate_fields to every Stripe APM without accounting for Blik’s distinct flow.

Additionally, we identified the need to maintain deployment discipline (no bypassing QA even in urgent situations) and perform comprehensive testing in staging for all affected payment methods before production.\n\n",

This flow was called by the webhook (a bad practice, because it should use the get internal, not the normal get) that failed to do the unmarshaling of a string.\n\n**Root cause:**  \nThe root cause of the problem was a change on the integration get flow that change the provider raw response from jsonRawMessage to string\n\n**Impact:**  \nHigh\n\n**Description of the incident's impact:**  \nThe incident caused that the webhook couldn't process the notifications and return 5XX errors\n\n**Detection:**  \nThe errors was identified by an opsgenie alert\n\n**Response and recovery:**  \nAs response the integrations team went on a call to talk about the last code changes and determine the root cause, then a PR with the fix was created and deployed to prod as soon as possible\n\n**Corrective and Preventive Measures:**  \nAs corrective we must define that the webhooks always have to use the get internal, in this case the get flow was updated and affected the webhook behavior  \nA preventive measure is to check webhook int calls before any int update to ensure proper webhook performance with the int changes.  \nAdditionally, we don't have an automated testing pipeline for webhooks to ensure that notifications will continue to process correctly when making changes.",

We identified that the issue was on the egress, we were sending to Klap the NT instead of the DPAN. The fix was to change the egress command to send the DPAN, this solved the issue and the purchases using NT were successful\n\n**Root cause:**  \nThe root cause of this issue was that we were sending wrong data to the Klap provider (NT instead of the DPAN) leading to purchases being declined.\n\n**Impact:**  \nMedium\n\n**Description of the incident's impact:**  \nThe impact of this incident was a low approval rate of for the purchases with NT for the Klap provider, the purchases without it were processed successfully\n\n**Detection:**  \nThis issue was detected by the TAM/KAM team in #product_tech channel.\n\n**Response and recovery:**  \nActions taken in response to the incident were to check the egress command used behavior and compare with similar ones that were working in prod environment. Then the difference in data sent was identified and the fix coding process started from the integrations team. This command was only used by the klap-int so it was quickly approved and deployed in prod to test it's behavior. Then the TAM/KAM team turned on the purchase flow with NT for the Compara merchant in Klap provider and we started to see purchases approved.\n\n**Corrective and Preventive Measures:**  \nPreventive measures (responsables):  \n1\\. Define a claude.md file with enough context of the different commands and egress responsabilities that will help the developer code and check the logic of new commands (integrations team)  \n2\\. When the provider (in this case klap) does not have test environment we must always make a prod controlled test to avoid low approval rate for our merchants. (integrations team + QA team)",

The issue lasted approximately 5 minutes and was caused by human error while updating DNS entries manually through the AWS console.\n\n**Root cause:**  \nA human error caused by confusion from a residual filter in the AWS Route53 console led to the DNS for the payment transactions database being mistakenly updated to point to the global endpoint of the microservices RDS cluster.\n\n**Impact:**  \nHigh\n\n**Description of the incident's impact:**  \nThe payment transactions service lost connectivity with its own RDS database, resulting in failed database connections and critical transaction errors. The system was impacted for approximately 5 minutes.\n\n**Detection:**  \nErrors appeared shortly after the DNS update. The engineer initially checked the intended microservices RDS update, but Datadog traces revealed that the payment transactions service was unable to connect to its own database.\n\n**Response and recovery:**  \nOnce the misconfiguration was identified, the engineer manually rolled back the DNS change. The service was restored within about 5 minutes of the incident’s onset.\n\n**Corrective and Preventive Measures:**  \n• Manual DNS changes via the AWS console will no longer be allowed.  \n• A proper and consolidated process for managing DNS entries through Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) is still lacking and needs to be established.  \n• As part of the corrective action, an IaC module will be developed to manage DNS records in a controlled, versioned, and reviewable way.  \n• All future changes will require peer reviews and validation steps to ensure DNS entries are correct prior to deployment.",

This ID discrepancy caused:\n\nRefund transaction searches to always return empty results  \nSince no related transactions were found, the webhook discarded notifications without propagating them  \nAs a consequence, events never reached Kafka  \nRefund transaction statuses remained outdated in the system\n\n**Impact:**  \nMedium\n\n**Description of the incident's impact:**  \nThis error exclusively affected refund notifications, while other types of notifications presumably continued to work correctly, which may have made early detection of the problem more difficult.\n\n**Detection:**  \nThe incident was initially detected through a customer support inquiry reporting an abnormal accumulation of transactions stuck in \"awaiting confirmation from the provider\" status. The key indicators that triggered the investigation were:\n\nVolume anomaly: Hundreds of payments were found in pending status, significantly exceeding normal operational thresholds.  \nTime anomaly: Some transactions had been in this state for several days, well beyond the expected confirmation timeframe.  \nPattern recognition: The accumulation specifically affected refund transactions, while regular payment notifications appeared to be processing normally.\n\n**Response and recovery:**  \nWe performed GET requests to the provider (Santander) to verify the actual status of all transactions stuck in \"awaiting confirmation\" state. We compiled a detailed list of these transactions and, whenever a status discrepancy was identified, collaborated with the Core team to manually update the transactions to their correct state. This manual synchronization ensured customer-facing statuses accurately reflected the provider's records.\n\nIn parallel, we identified and corrected the incorrect ID mapping in the santander-webhook microservice that was causing the issue. The fix was thoroughly tested in lower environments to confirm that refund notifications were being properly processed and successfully propagated to Kafka. Once validated, the fix was deployed during the next available deployment window, with post-deployment monitoring confirming that new refund notifications were being processed correctly\n\n**Corrective and Preventive Measures:**  \nwe established a new requirement for future developments: any webhook implementations or modifications that perform GET requests to the integration service must include documented evidence demonstrating that the ID lookup is using the correct identifier format. This evidence must be part of the development and code review process, showing end-to-end testing results that verify successful transaction matching",

This mismatch causes all subsequent refund operations to fail with a \"Charge not found\" error, as the refund service expects a transaction ID. The issue affects all transactions processed through the pagarme-int integration since the bug was introduced, requiring both a code fix and a database migration to resolve historical data.\n\n**Root cause:**  \nTechnical Root Cause:\n\n* **Location:** `service.go`, line 174 in the capture service\n* **Specific Issue:** Incorrect field mapping during capture response processing\n* **Code snippet:**\n\n    ```\n    response.ProviderTransactionID = provResponse.Order.ID\n    ```\n\nContributing Factors:\n\n1. **Lack of Response Mapping Documentation:** The product team had not provided proper response mapping specifications\n2. **Developer Assumptions:** Without clear documentation, the developer made incorrect assumptions about field mappings\n3. **Insufficient Test Coverage:** QA testing did not include end-to-end scenarios covering capture followed by refund\n4. **Code Review Gap:** The incorrect mapping was not caught during code review\n5. **Missing Integration Tests:** No automated tests validated the complete payment lifecycle\n\n**Impact:**  \nMedium\n\n**Description of the incident's impact:**  \nFinancial Impact:\n\n* 26,000 transactions unable to be refunded through normal channels\n* Increased operational costs for manual processing\n\nOperational Impact:\n\n* Support team overwhelmed with refund failure tickets\n* Manual database queries required for each refund\n* Engineering resources diverted from planned work\n\nCustomer Experience Impact:\n\n* Merchants unable to process customer refunds in Yuno\n* Loss of trust in the payment platform\n* Negative impact on merchant's relationship with their customers\n\n**Detection:**  \nThe incident was detected when Goold reported systematic issues with refunds through the payment system. The initial detection stemmed from an escalation by Goold's support team after receiving multiple complaints from merchants unable to process refunds. During the investigation, the engineering team used Datadog to analyze error logs, where they identified a consistent pattern of \"Charge not found\" errors occurring specifically during refund attempts. Deep analysis of the source code confirmed the discrepancy between the ID stored during capture and the ID expected during refund. The lack of proactive monitoring of refund success rates meant the issue persisted undetected for a considerable period, affecting 26,000 transactions before being identified. This delay in detection highlights a critical gap in our observability systems, as we had no alerts configured to detect systematic failures in refund operations, relying entirely on reactive customer reports.\n\n**Response and recovery:**  \nThe fix is implemented, which resolves this for new captures. For all of the above, a database update will need to be run to fix this.\n\n**Corrective and Preventive Measures:**  \nMore comprehensive testing is required; in this case, there was no test set available to validate the refund after capture.\n\nThe analysis must define which ID is required for subsequent operations.  \nAll combinations of operations must be tested during the QA stage.",

        "description": "## 🕵️ Incident Summary\n\n* **Date:** July 23, 2025 <custom data-type=\"smartlink\" data-id=\"id-0\">https://yuno-whs1055.slack.com/archives/D05L12N1YUW/p1756990297716999</custom> \n* **Issue:** Apple Pay transactions on **Stripe** failed due to an invalid format in the **ECI (Electronic Commerce Indicator)** field.\n* **Root Cause:** The `replace_network_token` command did not pad single-digit ECI values (e.g., `6` instead of `06`). Stripe requires all ECIs to be two-digit strings.\n* **Impact Duration:** 1:55 PM – 9:12 PM\n* **Impact:** 3,379 failed transactions (\\~USD $53,229.41), mainly affecting **Rappi**.\n* **Resolution:** A formatting function (`formatEci`) was introduced to ensure ECIs are always two digits.\n\n---\n\n## 📉 Impact and Detection\n\n* QA did not catch the issue because:\n\n    * Testing focused on **Android devices** (which send 2-digit ECIs).\n    * **iOS tests** targeted Adyen and DLocal, which accept single-digit ECIs.\n    * **Stripe tests** were done via Postman, which also used 2-digit ECIs.\n    \n\n---\n\n## 🛠️ Resolution\n\n1. Root cause identified at 8:00 PM.\n2. Fix implemented at 8:10 PM.\n3. Fix deployed to production at 9:10 PM.\n4. By 9:12 PM, approval rates had stabilized.\n\n---\n\n## 📋 Corrective and Preventative Measures\n\n* **Mandatory QA checklist**: validate field formatting and gateway responses.\n* **Cross-platform device testing**: require both iOS and Android coverage.\n* **Approval rate monitoring**: real-time alerts by provider and payment method.\n* **Log-based validation**: include gateway response checks in QA.\n* **Automation**: automated tests for provider-specific validations.\n* **Device farm**: maintain a pool of iOS and Android devices for QA.\n\n---\n\n## 🔑 Key Lessons Learned\n\n* **Device diversity matters**: iOS and Android behave differently in formatting.\n* **Gateway responses are the source of truth**: command validation alone is insufficient.\n* **Simulations ≠ real traffic**: Postman tests did not replicate real device behavior.\n* **Approval rate is a health metric**: must be monitored continuously.\n\n---\n\n## ⏱️ Timeline (UTC-5)\n\n* **01:40 PM**: PCI-APPLEPAY deployed.\n* **01:55 PM**: Transaction failures begin.\n* **07:00 PM**: Alerts raised for approval rate drop.\n* **08:00 PM**: Root cause identified.\n* **08:10 PM**: Fix implemented.\n* **09:10 PM**: Fix deployed.\n* **09:12 PM**: Service stabilized.\n\n---\n\n👉 This incident highlighted a **QA gap in format validation** specific to Stripe. Stronger cross-platform testing, real traffic validation, and gateway-focused monitoring will prevent similar issues going forward.",

Shutdown procedure was not clean and pods living in that instance were affected.\n\n**Root cause:**  \nEC2 faulty hardware.  \nOur analisys indicates that the instance lost connectivity without going through the usual shutdown procedures. The instance lost connectivity but was not deregistered from the EKS control-plane. That caused all the pods living in that instance to fail. When EKS acknowleadge this issue, all the pods were drained and moved to another instance. Affected pods belonged to the following microservices:\n\n* customer-payment-method-ms\n* organization-ms\n* organization-webhook-ms\n* checkout-session-ms\n* chargeback-ms\n* datalake-ms\n* stripe-int\n* checkout-int\n* azul-int\n* khipu-int\n\nThe weird thing is that we had no anticipation of this operation from AWS. We received the notification when the HW failure was discovered and when the instance whas shut-down. That happend in REAL TIME.\n\n**Impact:**  \nLow\n\n**Description of the incident's impact:**  \n\\~800 transactions were affected with status 500.\n\n**Detection:**  \nAlerts arrived via Opsgenie for failing transactions to the corresponding teams.\n\n**Response and recovery:**  \nThe recovery was fully managed by EKS: when the pods started to respond an error to their health-check, the cluster stopped sending traffic to those pods and moved them to another instance.\n\n**Corrective and Preventive Measures:**  \nWe already have worker checking on AWS health events. We've checked and the event arrived at the same time the instance was already affected. Nothing to do in this case.",

During this period, 3,250 transactions were approved by our payment system but failed to be properly recorded in our database due to a schema mismatch introduced in a recent deployment.\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n* No data confidentiality, integrity, or PCI compliance was compromised\n* All affected transactions will be recovered and properly processed\n* Root cause identified and preventive measures implemented\n* Service fully restored with no ongoing impact\n\n---\n\n## Root Cause Analysis\n\n### Primary Cause\n\nThe incident was caused by a database schema incompatibility introduced during the deployment of version v2.0.3. Specifically:\n\n* A code change attempted to insert data into a column that did not exist in the production `operations` table\n* This resulted in failed INSERT operations for transaction records\n* While payment processing continued normally, transaction persistence to our database failed\n\n### Contributing Factors\n\n1. **Deployment Timing:** The deployment occurred late in the maintenance window, limiting time for proper monitoring and quick rollback\n2. **Schema Validation:** Database schema changes were not properly validated against the production environment before deployment\n\n---\n\n## Impact Assessment\n\n### Business Impact\n\n* **Transaction Volume:** 3,250 transactions affected across four clients\n* **Financial Impact:** No financial loss - all transactions were properly approved and will be recovered\n* **Service Availability:** 90-minute degradation in transaction recording (payment processing remained functional)\n\n### Technical Impact\n\n* Database INSERT operations failed for the `operations` table\n* Transaction approval process continued working normally\n* No data corruption or security compromise occurred\n\n### Client Impact\n\n* **Hotmart, Playboy, INTI, Petz:** Temporary gap in transaction reporting\n* Payment processing remained uninterrupted for end customers\n* Transaction data recovery in progress\n\n---\n\n## Timeline of Events\n\n```\nTimeEvent \nT+0 min Deployment of v2.0.3 completed\nT+15 min Initial alerts received from automated monitoring \nT+30 min Low conversion rate alerts triggered\nT+35 min Failed rollback attempt by the developer\nT+45 min Technical Account Manager (TAM) notification received\nT+50 min Close deploy window, request help for rollback to manager\nT+60 min Root cause identified (database schema mismatch)\nT+90 min Rollback to v1.9.8 completed and service restored\n```\n\n---\n\n## Detection and Response\n\n### Detection Methods\n\n1. **Automated Monitoring:** Initial alerts from our monitoring systems detected unusual patterns\n2. **Conversion Rate Monitoring:** Integration team identified decreased transaction conversion rates\n3. **Client Notification:** Technical Account Manager escalated client concerns\n\n### Response Actions\n\n1. **Immediate Investigation:** Engineering team began root cause analysis\n2. **Rollback Decision:** After identifying schema mismatch, decision made to rollback to stable version\n3. **Service Restoration:** Rollback to v1.9.8 completed, restoring normal operations\n4. **Client Communication:** Affected clients notified of incident and resolution\n\n---\n\n## Resolution and Recovery\n\n### Immediate Resolution\n\n* **Rollback Completed:** Service restored to v1.9.8 (previous stable version)\n* **Functionality Verified:** All database operations confirmed working correctly\n* **Monitoring Resumed:** Normal transaction processing and recording restored\n\n### Transaction Recovery Plan\n\n* **Data Recovery:** All 3,250 affected transactions identified through system logs\n* **Recovery Process:** Systematic restoration of transaction records to database\n* **Validation:** Each recovered transaction will be verified for data integrity\n* **Timeline:** Recovery process expected to complete within 48 hours\n\n---\n\n## Preventive Measures\n\nTo prevent similar incidents in the future, we are implementing the following measures:\n\n### 1. Deploy Schedule Policy vs Maintenance Window\n\n**Problem Addressed:** Late deployment timing that prevented effective rollback within the maintenance window.\n\n**Implementation:**\n\n* All deployments must begin minimum 2 hours before maintenance window closure\n* If maintenance window closes at 23:00, last deployment allowed at 21:00\n* Exception only with Engineering Manager approval and Database Administrator present\n* Rollback execution remains with the deploying engineer to avoid bottlenecks\n\n**Timeline:** Immediate implementation (policy active now)\n\n### 2. Post-Deploy On-Call Scheme\n\n**Problem Addressed:** Lack of immediate ownership and responsibility during incident response.\n\n**Implementation:**\n\n* Person executing deployment automatically enters 24-hour on-call rotation\n* Responsible for monitoring rede-int service specifically during this period\n* Must be available for rollback execution within 30 minutes if contacted\n* Clear escalation path: Deployer → On-call Team → Engineering Manager\n* If deployer unavailable, must explicitly delegate to another team member\n\n**Timeline:** Implementation by June 10th, 2025",

Although the database migration was completed without issues, the deployed version of the service was outdated and not aligned with the expected application state, resulting in inconsistent behavior and partial service impact.\n\nThe issue was detected via monitoring and manual report and resolved by deploying the correct version of the microservice. \n\n**Root cause:**  \nWe suspect a bug in the status reporting mechanism of Argo Rollouts during canary deployments. Specifically, when a canary deployment is in progress during an infrastructure event—such as a database migration—the version reported as \"running\" may not accurately reflect the actual version being served.\n\nIn this case, the deployment appeared successful and stable from the rollout dashboard, but the active pods were still running an older version of the microservice. As a result, the environment moved forward assuming the latest version was live, when in fact the previous one remained in place.\n\nThis mismatch led to application behavior inconsistent with the intended post-migration state.\n\n**Impact:**  \nMedium\n\n**Description of the incident's impact:**  \nOne of our clients, who relies on the Redeban integration, experienced partial service disruption as a result of the incorrect microservice version being deployed. While core functionality remained operational, certain features depending on the latest version were either degraded or unavailable. This caused delays and inconsistencies in transaction processing for that client during the affected period.\n\nNo data was lost, and the issue was contained to a specific use case without broader impact on other clients or integrations.\n\n**Detection:**  \nThe issue was initially detected through automatic alerts from Datadog, including both Microservice Monitors and Watchdog anomaly detection. The following alerts were triggered:\n\n1\\. \\***May 29, 2025 7:53 AM (GMT-03:00)**\\* – Via Datadog Microservice Monitor  \n\\[View alert\\]([https://yunopayments.app.opsgenie.com/alert/detail/9cd193ee-09c9-4511-8418-a9a3d266d214-1748516037178/details](https://yunopayments.app.opsgenie.com/alert/detail/9cd193ee-09c9-4511-8418-a9a3d266d214-1748516037178/details))\n\n2\\. \\***May 29, 2025 8:03 AM (GMT-03:00)**\\* – Via Datadog Watchdog  \n\\[View alert\\]([https://yunopayments.app.opsgenie.com/alert/detail/05f323a6-e2b2-47c2-bc99-53f16f02713c-1748516636473/details](https://yunopayments.app.opsgenie.com/alert/detail/05f323a6-e2b2-47c2-bc99-53f16f02713c-1748516636473/details))\n\n3\\. \\***May 29, 2025 8:33 AM (GMT-03:00)**\\* – Via Datadog Watchdog  \n\\[View alert\\]([https://yunopayments.app.opsgenie.com/alert/detail/baa563e6-2f06-4f29-a849-c2dad626f5ce-1748518418358/details](https://yunopayments.app.opsgenie.com/alert/detail/baa563e6-2f06-4f29-a849-c2dad626f5ce-1748518418358/details))\n\n4\\. \\***May 29, 2025 9:38 AM (GMT-03:00)**\\* – Via Datadog Watchdog  \n\\[View alert\\]([https://yunopayments.app.opsgenie.com/alert/detail/9d330fbb-f96d-4b1b-baa4-f69305b0b0de-1748522317363/details](https://yunopayments.app.opsgenie.com/alert/detail/9d330fbb-f96d-4b1b-baa4-f69305b0b0de-1748522317363/details))\n\n5\\. \\***May 29, 2025 1:18 PM (GMT-03:00)**\\* – Via Datadog Microservice Monitor  \n\\[View alert\\]([https://yunopayments.app.opsgenie.com/alert/detail/dcbffb2f-ecde-4bff-8221-4f30a8674333-1748535538394/details](https://yunopayments.app.opsgenie.com/alert/detail/dcbffb2f-ecde-4bff-8221-4f30a8674333-1748535538394/details))\n\n6\\. \\***May 29, 2025 1:30 PM (GMT-03:00)**\\* – Via Datadog Microservice Monitor  \n\\[View alert\\]([https://yunopayments.app.opsgenie.com/alert/detail/0dee59e2-e550-4916-9a70-3aa842f8288d-1748536256261/details](https://yunopayments.app.opsgenie.com/alert/detail/0dee59e2-e550-4916-9a70-3aa842f8288d-1748536256261/details))\n\nIn parallel, members of the product and technology teams reported issues with the Redeban integration in the shared Slack channel, which helped validate the alerts and accelerate investigation.\n\n**Response and recovery:**  \nUpon receiving the initial alerts, the engineering team began investigating potential causes of the issue. Given the recent database migration, the team first validated the state and integrity of the migrated data, confirming that it was consistent and correct.\n\nAttention then shifted to the application layer, where it was discovered that the deployed version of the microservice did not match the expected post-migration release. Once identified, the team promptly deployed the correct version of the microservice that aligned with the current application state and integration logic.\n\nAfter the fix, monitoring signals stabilized, and functionality for the impacted client was restored.\n\n**Corrective and Preventive Measures:**  \nTo prevent similar incidents in the future, the following actions have been taken or are currently in progress:\n\nMonitoring Review: A full audit and revision of all Datadog monitors related to this microservice and its integrations to ensure proper alerting coverage and thresholds.\n\nImproved Coordination: All teams involved in infrastructure changes (DevOps, backend, product) will now join a dedicated coordination meeting prior to any infrastructure migration, to align on potential impacts, deployment status, and rollback readiness.\n\nMigration Script Improvements: The DevOps team is enhancing the ad-hoc internal migration automation scripts to include validation steps that confirm the deployed application version matches the expected post-migration release.\n\nGenerate a complete list of all integrations with production traffic that have triggered alerts in Opsgenie, creating an individual tracking task for each one that includes the current status of resolution progress, assigned responsible person, documentary evidence (screenshots, logs, implemented steps), and a periodic reporting system that allows monitoring progress until complete resolution of each incident.\n\nImplement and design a rollback plan: This will help us define a standard way to proceed in this cases to avoid future mistakes. For any rollback situation, the information and evidence that is attached must include the same as a common and standard deployment process, supporting this rollback.",

Esto provocó un error en el mapeo, ya que cualquier transacción con MAC era marcada como “declined”, incluso si había sido aprobada. Como consecuencia, el comercio reintentaba la operación con otro proveedor que también aprobaba el pago, lo que resultaba en un doble cobro al cliente.\n\nAnalisis de la documentación con más precision, tanto para el desarrollo como para el análisis del issue. \n\nEl análisis indicaba que cuando venga un MAC, debemos mapear a estados declinados y eso tomo como única verdad. \n\nSe realizo un comentario en el ticket de JIRA sobre la precedencia que tenía este MAC sobre otros mapeos, y se ubico el mapeo del MAC primero, haciendo que se decline aún cuando el estado no era refused pero el MAC era devuelto por el provider.\n\nConsultar al provider por documentación ambigua. \n\nUna sección menciona que se devuelve el MAC para pagos fallidos con Mastercard, pero otra parte de la documentación indica que es tanto para pagos exitosos como fallidos.\n\n**Root cause:**  \nAnalisis incompleto\n\n**Impact:**  \nHigh\n\n**Description of the incident's impact:**  \nDoble cobro al cliente, se detectaron 1971 transacciones con este problema.\n\n**Detection:**  \nel dia Miercoles 30-04-2025 a las 11:03PM fue detectado por Rappi\n\n**Response and recovery:**  \nAl momento de ser levantado esto por adyen fue atentido por integraciones para ser analizado y realilzando el rollback de la version con el error a las 11:24 lo cual resolvio el incidente.\n\nya se realizo el fix sobre esto y se encuentra listo para ser desplegado.\n\n**Corrective and Preventive Measures:**\n\n* Como medida preventiva se pide a los desarrolladores hacer una doble validacion del analisis a la hora de tomar el desarrollo y ser mas cuidadosos en el analisis de priorizacion de mapeos de status\n* Desarrollar una herramienta de verificacion de estatus aprobados con declinados: esta herramienta parte de una idea llamada “conciliador de pagos”, la cual podria verificar cuando el estatus de una transaccion no coincide con lo “mapeado” por la integracion.\n* Los analistas podrian darle una base de conocimiento a la Claude (o cualquier otra IA) sobre el mapeo de los estatus de cada proveedor y a la hora de realizar otro mapeo esta herramienta podria verificar si alguno de estos estatus se contrapone a lo que indica el provider emitiendo un warning\n\n",

        "description": "**Date:**   \n2025-04-30\n\n**Owner:**  \nintegrations\n\n**Affected Services:**  \nmercadopago-int\n\n**Affected Clientes:**  \nGood Meal\n\n**Total incident impact time (in seconds):**  \n284566.0\n\n**Total number of affected transactions:**  \n575\n\nOnly for mobile:\n\n* Affected versions: v2.30.1\n* Fix version: v2.30.2\n\n**Severity:**  \nS2 - High Severity\n\nI'll create a comprehensive postmortem for the incident you described. Here's the content for each of the requested sections:\n\n**Executive Summary:** \n\nOn the previous week, we experienced a significant decline in card purchase approval rates following the implementation of a new request field for card brand and type information. The issue caused approval rates to drop from approximately 70% to 20% for affected merchants due to BIN mismatches between our system and the payment provider. The incident was detected through merchant escalation to our TAM team. We resolved the issue by removing the problematic data field from purchase requests rather than attempting to reconcile the BIN discrepancies, which fall under BI team responsibility. Normal service was restored with minimal implementation effort once the root cause was identified.\n\n**Root Cause:** \n\nThe primary cause of the incident was the introduction of a new request field containing card brand and type information without proper validation of BIN compatibility between our system and the payment provider. This resulted in a mismatch between our BIN data and the provider's data, causing the provider to decline a large percentage of otherwise valid transactions. The discrepancy in BIN data is maintained by different teams (our system versus BI area), contributing to the coordination gap that allowed the incompatible change to be deployed.\n\n**Description of the Incident's Impact:** \n\nThe incident resulted in a dramatic decrease in approval rates, from approximately 70% to 20% for affected merchants. This significant drop in successful transactions likely led to:\n\n* Lost revenue for merchants due to failed legitimate transactions\n* Poor customer experience for end users attempting purchases\n* Increased support inquiries from frustrated merchants and customers\n* Potential damage to merchant trust in our payment processing capabilities\n* Temporary increase in workload for the TAM team handling escalations\n\n**Detection:** \n\nThe issue was not detected through our internal monitoring systems or pre-deployment testing. Instead, it was identified reactively when a merchant reported a substantial drop in approval rates to our TAM team. The merchant observed the decline from 70% to 20% in their approval rate metrics and escalated the issue through proper channels. This external detection indicates a gap in our monitoring and testing protocols for payment processing changes.\n\n**Response and Recovery:** \n\nUpon identification of the issue:\n\n1. The TAM team escalated the merchant report to the development team for investigation\n2. Analysis revealed the correlation between the new card brand/type field implementation and the increase in declined transactions\n3. The development team confirmed the BIN mismatch as the root cause\n4. Rather than attempting to reconcile the BIN data (which would require cross-team coordination with BI), we implemented the simpler and more immediate solution of removing the problematic field from purchase requests\n5. We deployed the fix and verified that approval rates returned to normal levels\n6. We communicated resolution status to affected merchants through the TAM team\n\n**Corrective and Preventive Measures:** \n\nTo prevent similar incidents in the future, we recommend implementing the following measures:\n\n1. **Enhanced Testing Protocol**:\n\n    * Extend canary deployments, roll up with shorter percentage\n    * Add approval rate monitoring by merchant as a key metric in deployment\n    * Create test cases specifically for payment field validation against provider requirements\n    \n2. **Improved Monitoring**:\n\n    * Set up real-time alerts for significant drops in approval rates by merchant\n    * Implement dashboards to track approval rates by merchant, card type, and provider\n    * Create automated anomaly detection for payment processing metrics\n    \n3. **Cross-Team Coordination**:\n\n    * Establish a formal review process for payment field changes that includes the BI team\n    * Create a shared responsibility matrix for BIN data management\n    * Schedule regular sync meetings between development and BI teams\n    \n4. **Documentation Improvements**:\n\n    * Document dependencies between our BIN data and provider requirements\n    * Maintain a comprehensive list of payment fields and their validation requirements\n    \n\n",

Although this monitoring is already part of our routine, this incident showed us that we need to improve how we execute and validate it, especially after changes in production.\n\nAdditionally, we will improve Yuno’s alerting system by reviewing and refining the thresholds and triggers for critical metrics, such as sudden drops in approval rate, to guarantee faster internal detection and response.\n\nFrom the Monitoring/NOC team’s side, we will reinforce our operational processes to ensure better visibility and incident reporting. This includes improving shift handoff clarity, enhancing dashboard review routines, and re-aligning team responsibilities to avoid blind spots in monitoring. These actions are aimed at strengthening the discipline and consistency of our response processes.",

This made all 3DS service payments asynchronous. The reason for this change was to eliminate the extra cost caused by setup service calls to Netcetera on transactions that don’t involve 3DS.\n\nOnce the new architecture was defined and communicated, the change was implemented and deployed prior to web versioning in order to enforce it across all merchants.\n\nThe change was communicated twice during the tech daily and also by product-tech, where it was specified that the flow would become asynchronous for all transactions, but that this would have no impact on merchants' implementations.\n\nThis last statement had two problems:\n\nFor the data-only 3DS flow, all transactions are synchronous, meaning the flow could still work even if the client hadn’t implemented the complete flow (which was the case with Smile).\n\nIt assumes all clients are properly integrated, following all documentation steps.\n\nClients like Draftea, who weren’t correctly integrated, experienced issues, and it was necessary to roll back the flow.\n\nAdditionally, we identified opportunities for improvement in our documentation. It’s not entirely clear which flow should be followed to implement the SDK flow.\n\n**Root cause:**  \nChange in the flow that was not properly communicated and was not monitored across all scenarios in PROD.\n\n**Impact:**  \nMedium\n\n**Description of the incident's impact:**  \nFor clients with errors in their implementation, there was an impact on the payment experience—for example, Draftea, where the modal wouldn't close after completing the payment. For data-only clients without the complete step implemented, 100% of transactions remained in a pending state.\"\n\nLet me know if you want to polish it for a specific report or stakeholder!\n\n**Detection:**  \nThe KAM and TAM teams reported through product-tech the two cases that were raised by Smiles and Draftea.\n\n**Response and recovery:**  \nInitially, the plan was to create a version for Smiles and an alternative flow for Draftea, but on Wednesday, April 23rd, it was decided to roll back the new 3DS flow, and the rollback was completed on April 24th at 6:00 AM COT.\n\n**Corrective and Preventive Measures:**  \nAll changes to the web SDK will start being versioned so that a client must implement the new version in order to be impacted.\n\nDefine a process to communicate changes to existing flows, including setting an ETA between the announcement of the change and its deployment to PROD.\n\nReview and update our documentation to clearly outline the SDK flow and all the steps that need to be implemented.",

The web implementation was specifically coded for version 8.58, overlooking sub-versions. The code directed web version 8.58.0 to the old flow, but incorrectly routed sub-versions to the new flow, which they didn't support. This resulted in numerous pending payments. The issue impacted web users with 8.58 sub-versions, disrupting service and potentially affecting customer trust and revenue. Rapid root cause identification and resolution were critical to mitigate the impact.\n\n**Root cause:**  \nThe root cause was an **incomplete versioning logic in the code implementation and a lack of comprehensive testing considering sub-versions.**\n\nContributing factors include:\n\n* **Overly specific versioning logic:** The code only accounted for the exact 8.58.0 web version for the old flow, ignoring sub-versions.\n* **Insufficient testing for different versions:** Pre-deployment testing did not adequately cover scenarios with 8.58 sub-versions.\n\n**Impact:**  \nLow\n\n**Description of the incident's impact**\n\n**Detection:**  \nDuring post-deployment validations, we noticed that CEBC transactions were remaining pending for an extended period. Upon closer inspection, it was detected that the new action from the new flow was being received, while their current version does not support it\n\n**Response and recovery:**  \nA significant number of payments were recently detected in a pending state, and a rollback was performed\n\n**Corrective and Preventive Measures:**  \nCorrective:\n\n* Rollback\n* Update payment and transactions to ERROR and notify\n\nPreventive:\n\n* With the new web SDK versioning, this issue should not occur again, as it was specific to the web platform\n\n",

We've been reporting it this way since the beginning of time.\n\nNew filters broke the charts – When the provider and connection name filters were added, a single payment was being counted multiple times instead of once per route. This resulted in incorrect metrics across all payment-related charts.\n\nTimeline:  \nFeb 28  \nWith the migration to the data lake, Raúl realized that the models were being calculated from calculated_transactions, using transactionality as the basis, and reported it in the product-tech channel.  \n[https://yuno-whs1055.slack.com/archives/C03K3PMBEAY/p1740771153903869](https://yuno-whs1055.slack.com/archives/C03K3PMBEAY/p1740771153903869)\n\nMar 21  \nA deployment was made with a fix for the conversion rate so that filtering by provider or connection wouldn’t affect the calculations.  \n[https://github.com/yuno-payments/snowflake-ms/pull/141](https://github.com/yuno-payments/snowflake-ms/pull/141)\n\nLater on Mar 21, a rollback was done because the fix only addressed the filters, and didn’t fully account for the need to base calculations on payments instead of transactions.\n\nApr 1  \nA new deployment fixed the conversion rate by correcting both the filters and the actual calculation.\n\nApr 1 – Apr 6  \nMultiple complaints were received from merchants who began noticing inconsistencies. Since the conversion rate was now based on the new table while other sections still used the old one, this triggered user distrust and they began calculating the metrics themselves using reports—finding discrepancies.  \n[https://yuno-whs1055.slack.com/archives/C03K3PMBEAY/p1743088362942869](https://yuno-whs1055.slack.com/archives/C03K3PMBEAY/p1743088362942869)  \n[https://yuno-whs1055.slack.com/archives/C03K3PMBEAY/p1743103075963739](https://yuno-whs1055.slack.com/archives/C03K3PMBEAY/p1743103075963739)  \n[https://yuno-whs1055.slack.com/archives/C03K3PMBEAY/p1744211682912479](https://yuno-whs1055.slack.com/archives/C03K3PMBEAY/p1744211682912479)  \n[https://yuno-whs1055.slack.com/archives/C04H0MA0Y2J/p1743775396582509](https://yuno-whs1055.slack.com/archives/C04H0MA0Y2J/p1743775396582509)  \n[https://yuno-whs1055.slack.com/archives/C04H0MA0Y2J/p1743772506386069](https://yuno-whs1055.slack.com/archives/C04H0MA0Y2J/p1743772506386069)  \n[https://yuno-whs1055.slack.com/archives/C04H0MA0Y2J/p1743535643054019](https://yuno-whs1055.slack.com/archives/C04H0MA0Y2J/p1743535643054019)\n\n**Root cause:**  \nThe root cause of the issue is that the data models in the Insights section were based on transactions instead of payments, which is incorrect for calculating metrics like conversion rate. This flawed logic has been in place since the system's inception and went unnoticed until the migration to the data lake.\n\nAdditionally, when new filters such as provider and connection_name were introduced, a single payment was counted multiple times (once per matching route), which further distorted the accuracy of payment-related visualizations.\n\nIn summary:\n\nData model was wrongly based on transactions instead of payments.\n\nImproper filter logic led to duplicated counts.\n\nSource mismatch between dashboards: some visuals pointed to the new table while others still referenced the old one, causing inconsistencies and loss of trust from users.\n\n**Impact:**  \nMedium\n\n**Description of the incident's impact:**  \nMerchants experienced significant confusion and loss of trust due to inconsistencies in the reported metrics. The conversion rate began showing different values compared to what they had been used to, and these numbers didn’t match the rest of the data displayed in the Insights section.\n\nSince only the conversion rate metric was updated to reflect the correct logic (based on payments), while other related charts continued to use the old transaction-based logic, merchants began to cross-check data manually using exports and reports.\n\n**Detection:**  \nThe issue was detected on February 28th, during the migration to the data lake, when Raúl noticed that the conversion models were being calculated based on transactions (calculated_transactions) instead of actual payments. This raised a red flag, as the resulting metrics didn’t accurately reflect the business reality.\n\nRaúl immediately reported the anomaly in the #product-tech Slack channel, triggering a full review of the calculation logic used in the Insights section.\n\n**Response and recovery:**  \nThe recovery was a joint effort between the Dashboard and BI teams. It involved:\n\nReviewing the definitions of each visualization to ensure they aligned with the correct business logic.\n\nCreating new data models based on payments rather than transactions.\n\nUpdating the dashboard services to consume these new models properly.\n\n**Corrective and Preventive Measures:**  \nAll Insights models were built directly in Snowflake by the only person working with data on the Dashboard team at the time, without any peers to validate or perform QA on the work. Since the models were created directly in Snowflake and all relied on a single shared dimension, any change would impact multiple calculations at once, causing widespread inconsistencies.\n\nAdditionally, no testing was in place, as tests cannot be easily implemented directly in Snowflake.\n\nTo address this, we are taking the following actions:\n\nMigrating all these models to DBT, so that the code is version-controlled, goes through code reviews, and allows the implementation of data quality tests.\n\nTraining the Dashboard QA engineer to understand the definitions behind Insights, so they can evaluate not only the functional correctness of the dashboard but also the consistency and accuracy of the metrics.\n\nExploring QA automation for metrics validation going forward.",

El problema es que para un cliente quedo configurado en 5 milisegundos por un error humano. El servicio se deployo, se monitoreo y ante el error se rolleo con la configuracion correcta.  \nEsto causo 3 issues:  \n1\\. 253 Timeouts contra el proveedor a los 5 milisegundos.  \n2\\. 39 Pagos rechazados porque el circuit breaker estaba abierto.  \n3\\. 36 Pagos aprobados que marcamos como error (todos son complete de Yape y Nequi, el cual retorna una respuesta sincrona.

Align with the team about the dangers of this change and have them double check the variables before deploying.  \n2\\. Align with the team the importance of monitoring after this change (here we act correctly, but so that we are all synchronized).  \n3\\. Manage the cases of Yape and Nequi that give error but then are updated to succeeded in the webhook.\n\n4. Check if we could do a validation in the Lib.\n5.

PeruRail also experienced delays in capturing their transactions.  \n  \n**Root cause:**  \nImplementation of changes in the Niubiz integration without previously verifying the correct functioning of the change in active connections, affecting compatibility with Amex and Diners transactions. Additionally, we did not have an efficient validation and communication process with the entire TAM and KAM team before making the modifications.  \n\n**Impact:**  \nHigh - Client confidence was affected and they are considering don’t do it the ramp up \n\n‌\n\n**Description of the incident's impact:**  \nAvailability: Service interruption for SmartFit, preventing some transactions (all `Amex` and `Dinners` transactions were declined) processing with Niubiz.\n\nIntegrity: No data corruption occurred, but transactions could not be completed.\n\nThe impact was limited to SmartFit and PeruRail.

However, one of these indexes should not have been included, which caused the customer-payment-methods table to lock and the database connections to be blocked.

(At 5:44 a.m. CO)\n\n**Corrective and Preventive Measures:**  \nImplement a permission system so that only DBAs can execute structural changes in production (restricting the deployment of indexes through migrations).\n\nBefore executing a database change, implement a checklist that must include:  \nDBA approval in a management system.  \nValidation in pre-production.  \nConfirmation of performance impact.  \nDefinition of a recovery plan in case of issues.",

The provider logs correctly showed a declined reasonCode (031), but this wasn’t reflected accurately in the system, leading to merchants releasing products for unconfirmed payments.  \nThe bug occurred when capturing authorizations made long ago, where the system failed to propagate the provider’s declined status (031) to both transaction and payment statuses, showing \"approved\" on the dashboard instead.\n\n**Root cause:**  \nThe integration system with the Cielo provider (within the cielo-int microservice) relies on a single, shared map implemented in the code to determine the status of transactions, regardless of the operation type (purchase, refund, void, capture, etc.). This shared status map was originally designed as a centralized solution to translate provider status codes (e.g., 031 for \"declined\") into the system’s internal statuses (e.g., APPROVED, DECLINED). While this approach might have worked well initially, it became increasingly problematic over time due to system evolution and the layering of multiple fixes.\n\n**Impact:**  \nMedium\n\n**Description of the incident's impact:**  \nSeven transactions were marked as approved for which authorization expired.\n\n**Detection:**  \nThe merchant Gringo detected this issue.\n\n**Response and recovery:**  \nWe make a fix in order to fix the status mapping.\n\n**Corrective and Preventive Measures:**  \nThe immediate fix involved adjusting the cielo-int microservice to correctly handle these edge cases and deploying it with caution (via canary release) due to the code’s tight coupling. However, this was another bandage on a deeper issue. The long-term lesson is clear: the shared status map needs to be replaced with a more modular design—perhaps operation-specific mappings or a dynamic status resolution system—to reduce complexity, improve maintainability, and prevent similar bugs in the future.",

After the deployment, everything continued to function normally, but when this step became synchronous, the response time of that service started to add to the Kafka message processing time and messages began to queue up. At 1:12 PM, we joined a call due to reports of notification delays, and after reviewing for several hours, at 4:04 PM the problem was identified as the deployment. A rollback was performed, and it took the microservice until 6:00 PM to process all queued messages, after which clients returned to normal flow.\n\n**Root cause:**  \nA code error that removed asynchronous processing in merchant webhook notifications\n\n**Impact:**  \nHigh\n\n**Description of the incident's impact:**  \nFrom 1:17 PM until 6:00 PM, most clients with asynchronous operations had to shut down their asynchronous payment method operations. Some messages took up to 2 hours of delay to process\n\n**Detection:**  \n2025-02-1 1:17 PM COT war-room call starts\n\n**Response and recovery:**  \nRollback of the deployment that was causing the impact\n\n**Corrective and Preventive Measures:**  \nDeployment monitoring template  \nOpsgenie Kafka lag  \nOpsgenie WatchDog  \nStress tests for payment-event-orc to ensure all pods are listening to topics  \nAnalyze Circuit Breaker in organization-webhook-ms for merchant outages (see Adyen case)  \nArchitecture analysis: should communication between integrations and core be through Kafka?",

        "description": "The hypothesis we had was that the size of some of the raw objects was so large that the database was starting to experience delays in the persistence of these objects and as a consequence of this, the chain effect of keeping the connections active was generated.\n\nTo test the theory, stress tests were performed by running 4 instances of Jmeter with the test 400 users in the payment flow and the raw_response and raw_notification objects of 45,000 characters. During the more than 20 minutes of execution, the number of connections did not exceed 2, which allowed us to rule out the size of the raw objects as a reason for the incident.\n\n‌\n\nLa hipotesis que teniamos es que el tamaño de algunos de los objetos de raw eran tan grandes que la base de datos empezaba a tener delay en la persistencia de estos objetos y consecuencia de ello es que se generaba el efecto en cadena de mantener las conexiones activas\n\nPara comprobar la teoria se realizaron pruebas de estres ejecutando 4 instancias de Jmeter con la prueba 400 usuarios en el flujo de de pagos y  los objetos de raw_response y raw_notification de 45000 caracteres. Durante los mas de 20 minutos de ejecución el numero de conexiones no paso de 2 lo que permito descartar el tamaño de los raw como motivo del incidente ",

Preliminary analysis indicated an abnormal increase in database operations, which prompted a detailed examination.\n\nFurther investigation revealed a spike in the Average Active Sessions on one of our Amazon RDS instances. The dominant wait event identified was \"LWLock:BufferContent.\" This wait event is typically associated with delays in acquiring lightweight locks on the contents of shared memory buffers, which can significantly hinder the performance of queries and transactions by restricting access to these shared resources.\n\nThe heightened database load and increased wait times led to performance degradation, resulting in transaction delays and the observed HTTP 500 errors affecting the /payment endpoint.\n\nTo mitigate the issue and stabilize service performance, we initiated a controlled restart of the instances interfacing with the impacted RDS. This procedure effectively reset the connection pool and reduced contention, restoring normal operation by 9:48 PM COT.\n\n**Root cause:**  \nAn increase in I/O delay of the RDS for payment-transaction-ms followed by an increase in active connections.\n\n**Impact:**  \nHigh\n\n**Description of the incident's impact:**  \n\"Timeout in the /payment service\n\n**Detection:**  \nAlerts in the Slack channel followed by reports from Rappi about a downtime of our platform.\n\n**Response and recovery:**  \nA call takes place where the DBA team identifies the increase in active connections. In parallel, the development team performs a redeploy of the MS, which cuts off the database connections and causes the number of connections to return to normal.\n\n**Corrective and Preventive Measures:**  \nticket to AWS to get more details about the increase of I/O delay Case ID 173812570500858.\n\nStress tests to ensure that the MS was not maintaining too many active connections due to the size of the raw_response.

Following the incident resolution, an analysis identified the length of certain provider raw responses as a potential root cause. Given that a provisional measure was implemented to establish a maximum length constraint for this field. Subsequently, on October 29th, we received notification that our client was utilizing this specific field for transaction flow completion. Upon verification that the RDS incident was not correlated with this matter, the length restriction was removed.\n\n**Root cause:**  \nThe deployment of an adjustment to prevent an error without considering all potential client impacts.\n\n**Impact:**  \nHigh\n\n**Description of the incident's impact:**  \nHubLa and Telesena were unable to complete PIX transactions due to their inability to map the complete response object.\n\n**Detection:**  \nFollowing notification from the KAM and TAM teams, a rollback was executed on the object truncation implementation after stress testing conclusively demonstrated no correlation between this raw_response size and the database incident.\n\n**Response and recovery:**  \nStress tests with 4x the PROD volume during the incident to demonstrate whether the raw_response had any correlation with the increased database I/O delay  \nRollback of the adjustment\n\n**Corrective and Preventive Measures:**  \nDo not rush changes without considering customer impact.",

At Yuno, we have a timeout of 53 seconds, which began to degrade the response time of our /payment service due to request queuing. By 1:34 PM, the p50 of the /payment microservice reached 1 minute. At 1:53 PM, a call was made through the product-tech channel. At 2:16 PM, new DLOCAL instances were deployed that reduced the timeout to 10 seconds, and at 2:20 PM, the number of payment-rx-orc microservice instances was increased from 6 to 20. At 2:24 PM, the p50 began to decrease, and by 2:26 PM, all traffic returned to normal.\n\n**Root cause:**  \npayment-rx-orc is a bottleneck for all transactions. When the response time of a provider as large as DLOCAL (in terms of transaction volume) degrades, the response time of the entire service falls.\n\n**Impact:**  \nHigh\n\n**Description of the incident's impact:**  \nDuring the 53 minutes that the incident lasted, 50,223 transactions were affected. 29,326 transactions resulted in ERROR and 20,897 transactions were in CREATED status.\n\n**Detection:**  \n2025-01-22 1:27 PM COT DLOCAL outage begins   \n2025-01-22 1:37 PM COT first alert arrives about dlocal-int   \n2025-01-22 1:53 PM COT war-room call starts\n\n**Response and recovery:**  \nDuring the call, a new timeout of 10 seconds was set for DLOCAL and the number of payment-rx-orc instances was increased to 20.\n\n**Corrective and Preventive Measures:**  \n1\\. New Opsgenie group (\"cupula\") with an alert to all company heads and TLs when there is an increase in /payment service errors of 2%  \n2\\. Memory-based autoscaling  \n3\\. Circuit breaker in all integrations, prioritizing by integration volume  \n4\\. Integration timeouts through environment variables instead of code  \n5\\. Stress testing of provider timeouts, service outages, and other possible errors  \n6\\.

The incident affected Draftea's payment processing, specifically during the embedded Openpay 3DS authentication process.\n\n**Root cause:**  \nInitial Production Issue: Race condition in 3DS Flow  \nIn production, we discovered a race condition where webhook notifications for frictionless payments were arriving before the user was redirected to Openpay's URL  \nThis issue wasn't detected in staging as we couldn't emulate this specific timing behavior  \nThe SDK was displaying \"approved\" status prematurely due to early webhook reception, followed by an unnecessary redirection to the frictionless authentication screen, resulting in a frozen flow\n\nFix Implementation and Secondary Issue:  \nTo address the race condition, we implemented a fix with two key changes:  \nBlocked \"succeeded\" webhook notifications to prevent premature status updates  \nModified the flow to intercept redirections in our webhook service, where we could control the sequence: first process the status update, then handle the redirection to the merchant  \nHowever, this fix introduced a new issue: context cancellations in Go during the redirection process  \nWhen the context was cancelled (due to client disconnection or timeout), the redirection flow would fail, leaving transactions in a pending state  \nThis is particularly critical in payment flows where we need to ensure transaction status consistency regardless of connection issues\n\nContributing Factors:  \nInsufficient end-to-end testing: The feature was deployed to production without comprehensive QA testing. This was particularly critical for a complex 3DS flow that involves multiple redirections and status updates. Testing in SDK environment wasn't enough to catch these edge cases  \nComplex Flow Implementation: The 3DS redirect flow involves multiple steps (initial authorization, redirection, webhook notification, final redirect) making it particularly susceptible to timing and state management issues. The complexity of this flow required more thorough testing and error handling than was initially implemented\n\nInsufficient end-to-end testing: The feature was deployed to production without comprehensive QA testing.

Lack of documentation about the impact on merchant integrations when making changes to payment method types\n\n**Impact:**  \nLow\n\n**Description of the incident's impact:**\n\n* No impact on data confidentiality\n* No compromise of sensitive or PCI data\n* Data integrity maintained, although there is a historical categorization inconsistency\n* Service availability was not affected\n* Main impact was on merchant's internal integration and processes\n\n**Detection:**  \nThe incident was detected on January 17, 2025, when the TAM team reported that Livelo merchant identified issues in their internal flow due to the payment method type change.\n\n**Response and recovery:**  \n1\\. The incident was reported by the TAM team after Livelo identified integration issues  \n2\\. The change was maintained as it represents the correct payment method configuration  \n3\\. Communication was established with the affected merchant  \n4\\. No rollback was required as the change was technically correct  \n5\\. Coordination process was initiated with the merchant for system adaptation\n\n**Corrective and Preventive Measures:**  \nA new change management process is established where TAMs will have a central role in evaluating and communicating modifications that may impact multiple merchants. When a change affecting public API responses or shared logic is required, TAMs must consult with technical teams about the change's feasibility and, primarily, coordinate with potentially affected merchants to evaluate the impact on their integrations.  \nTAMs will be responsible for collecting and documenting merchant feedback, determining if the change is viable based on the collective impact.",

Once the issue was identified, the associated policy was regenerated, and everything returned to normal.\n\n**Root cause:**  \nMandatory migration to a newer version of the EKS cluster, which required the migration of all microservices within the cluster.\n\n**Impact:**  \nHigh\n\n**Description of the incident's impact:**  \nThe issue resulted in the loss of payments processed using network tokens.\n\n**Detection:**  \nARGENTINA TIME:  \n•\t17:08 - The MS replication to the new cluster is performed.  \n•\t17:10 - The MS pci-vault-nt-ms is detected as not starting correctly due to an issue with the associated policy.  \n•\t17:15 - The policy bug is fixed, and the MS responds correctly to health checks.  \n•\t17:25 - The traffic migration to the new cluster begins at 10%.  \n•\t17:47 - Errors are reviewed jointly with the Partners Integrations team.  \n•\t17:55 - The issue is resolved.\n\nThis error occurred due to a bug in the migration of microservices during the update to a new EKS cluster. When moving the policies associated with the pci-vault-nt-ms microservice using Crossplane, the policy was not correctly attached to the service.  \nWe detected the incorrect creation of the policy through the ARGO UI when verifying the microservices. The health check (HC) for the microservice in question responded correctly, but further investigation by the microservices team and analysis of metrics revealed the missing KMS policy.\n\n**Response and recovery:**  \nThe policy was regenerated and correctly attached.\n\n**Corrective and Preventive Measures:**  \nThe bug related to copying policies in Crossplane will be addressed.  \n<custom data-type=\"smartlink\" data-id=\"id-0\">https://yunopayments.atlassian.net/browse/PFU-113</custom>   \nA pipeline for cluster migration will be created.  \n[https://yunopayments.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CPS/pages/1424719956/KUBERNETES+CLUSTER+MIGRATION+TEMPLATE](https://yunopayments.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CPS/pages/1424719956/KUBERNETES+CLUSTER+MIGRATION+TEMPLATE)",
